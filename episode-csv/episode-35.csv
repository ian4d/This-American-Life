"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","1","Prologue","subject","Hazel","00:00:08.41","Just a pair of slacks, a knit top to go with it."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:00:12.93","And the color of the slacks?"
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","1","Prologue","subject","Hazel","00:00:14.13","The slacks are white."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:16.38","White after Labor Day. There was a time this woman, Hazel, would not have dared wear white after Labor Day, she says. But that tradition of autumn is long dead, so long dead it's barely even worth commenting on. That's right. There's only one tradition anybody like Hazel still follows come September."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","1","Prologue","subject","Hazel","00:00:39.15","Oh, yeah, I go to clearance sales, especially at the end of the summer when they've got all the winter clothes out. And you're looking for all the goodies that's left over. Oh, you can't miss that."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:00:48.50","Gotten anything this year like that?"
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","1","Prologue","subject","Hazel","00:00:50.39","Yes, I did."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:00:51.13","You did?"
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","1","Prologue","subject","Hazel","00:00:51.85","Uh-huh."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:00:52.30","What'd you get?"
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","1","Prologue","subject","Hazel","00:00:53.29","I got a beautiful pink sport jacket at Carson's. Oh, I got a nice bargain on it."

"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:47.21","Act Two, Haiku at the Scrimmage Line. Stories from Scott Carrier, one of our favorite contributors."

"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:56.82","Act Four, Grandma and Easy."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:00.85","I know, by the way, that some of you may have heard promos saying that our show today was going to be about a hot dog stand. And our program about the hot dog stand was not ready for you. It was not up to our standards."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:11.29","And so we are bringing you the program that we had planned for next week, which is in good shape. It's tomorrow's stories today. Stay with us."

"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","Ira Glass","00:02:50.46","David is not somebody who likes being naked. As he's written, he doesn't even like walking around the house barefoot, much less nude. He doesn't sleep in the nude. And so this was his personal challenge to himself."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","Ira Glass","00:03:04.42","During the summer, he read a portion of this story with his sister Amy at a club called KGB in New York City. And as you're going to hear, these are just anecdotes from a larger story. It's not a complete story. But it's really funny and interesting and fun to listen to."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","Ira Glass","00:03:20.09","So before we start, a quick warning. There's no sex in this story. In fact, it's possibly the least sexy imaginable story. But there are references to specific body parts that might not be judged suitable for some children. So use your judgment."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:03:40.07","It is disconcerting to talk to someone on the phone and know that they are naked. Every now and then, I might call a friend who says, ""You caught me on the way to the shower,"" but that's different. The man at the nudist colony sounded as though he had been naked for years. Even his voice was tanned."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:03:57.95","""All right then. Have you ever visited us before? No? Well, you're in for a treat. I'd be happy to send you a brochure. Let me just get your information here."""
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:04:08.40","In this afternoon's mail, I received my brochure, along with a pamphlet that reads ""Body acceptance is the idea. Nude recreation is the way. Bring your towels and suntan lotion and relax with us. You will experience a freedom of movement that cannot be felt with clothes, the freedom to be yourself."""
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:04:28.64","The brochure pictures a swimming pool, playground, sun deck, and the inevitable volleyball court, which leads me to wonder, what is it with these people and volleyball? The two go hand in hand. When I think nudist, I don't think penis. I think net."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:04:45.91","Last night, I was in a foul mood and provoked Hugh into a fight, goading him until he fled the room, shouting, ""You're a big, fat, hairy pig."" Big is something I can live with. Fat is open to interpretation. But when coupled with hairy, it begins to form a mental picture which is brought into sharp focus when joined by the word ""pig."" A big, fat, hairy, pig. If I were nudist, Hugh's words wouldn't have hurt me, as I would've accepted myself for who I am."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:05:18.46","I phoned the colony to make a reservation and spoke to the same fellow who had mailed me the brochure. This time, I could hear people in the background, splashing and yelling in merriment. The sound of them made me giddy, and I unbuttoned my slacks."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:05:35.03","The brochure had mentioned rental cabins, and I was wondering what it might cost to stay for a week. ""You want a trailer for how long?"" he asked. I re-fastened my pants. A trailer? I had pictured tree-shaded bungalows, paneled in knotty pine. That, to me, is the essence of the word ""colony."" This place, instead, was a nudist trailer park."

"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","Unspecified","00:05:59.52","""We don't use the word 'colony' anymore, because it's too spooky. No, what we have are trailers. The smaller units run $30 a night. But if you want your own kitchen and bathroom, your only option is a double-wide, which will run you $10 more."" He'd lost me way back. How was the word ""colony"" spooky, but not the word ""trailer""?"

That's not booked yet."" Front bedroom suggested the evidence of a back bedroom, which I was told would be rented out separately. ""You might have one roommate, or maybe it'll be a couple. Don't worry. You won't get lonely."""
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","Unspecified","00:06:39.67","A roommate at a nudist trailer park. The combination of these elements presented a staggering tableau, made all the more incomprehensible when I heard the man shoulder the phone and raise his voice to shout, ""Mom! Hey, mom! Where's the weekly price list for the two-bedroom rental trailer?"" This person was not only standing naked in broad daylight. He was doing it with his mother. I made my reservations and planned to arrive in one week."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","Unspecified","00:07:09.75","I called the park again today, and a woman answered. When asked if they provide sheets and pillows, she said--"

"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:07:22.99","I asked if the trailer's kitchen was equipped. And she replied--"
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","Amy Sedaris","00:07:25.50","""Eh, kind of."""
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:07:28.24","Seeing as I would be there for a week, I was hoping she might elaborate."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","Amy Sedaris","00:07:31.50","""Well, it kind of has some things and not some others."""

"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","Amy Sedaris","00:07:37.13","""Oh, sure. There's a sink up there and probably some pans and so forth, but definitely no towels. You'll have to pack your own, because we can't be running back and forth like that. We haven't got the time for that kind of thing."""
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:07:48.26","I told her I understood--"
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","Amy Sedaris","00:07:49.61","""A lot of folks think we keep a nice, fluffy stack of towels up by the pool for their own private use, but we don't do that. Not here, we don't. Not anymore."""

"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","Amy Sedaris","00:08:03.52","""So sometimes, a person might come in for a day and leave their towel behind by accident. But we put that towel in the lost and found box, in case they come back looking for it. You can't use those towels, because they're not clean, and they don't belong to you."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","Amy Sedaris","00:08:17.31","That somebody might come back one day to claim that towel. And it wouldn't do for them to walk in and find you using it without their permission. It wouldn't be right."

I arrived early on this cold and wet afternoon, the cab driver dumping me off in front of the clubhouse before squealing away. Something about the place seemed to make him nervous, and he couldn't wait to get back into town. I collected my bag and entered a low, clapboard building where five fully dressed senior citizens sat hugging themselves against the cold and watching the local news on a color television bolted to a high shelf. On the screen, a weatherman was pointing to a map studded with frowning clowns-- clouds."

In the Nude","host","Unspecified","00:09:15.14","On the screen, a weatherman was pointing to a map studded with frowning suns, his arms positioned as if he were drawing a heavy curtain. The inhabitants of the room leaned forward in their chairs, biting the ridges of their clenched fists and groaning when confronted with the words ""cold front."" They booed the weatherman. They cursed him, and then they pounded upon the table tops, much like prisoners unhappy with their food."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","Unspecified","00:09:40.27","The room was filled with the rhythmic thuds of protest as I sat down my suitcase and approached the front desk. ""He did this,"" a man said, pointing his crooked finger in my direction. ""Brought this nastiness with him down from the lakes."""
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","Amy Sedaris","00:09:55.51","""You from the lakes?"""
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:09:57.36","--the woman behind the counter asked. The corners of her mouth hung so low, they grazed the line of her jaw. She narrowed her eyes upon my suitcase, almost suspecting to find it blustering across the floor, packed as it was with storm clouds and unseasonable winds."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:10:13.01","""I don't know anything about any lakes."" There was a rising panic in my voice. ""It was hot and sunny when I left this morning. Really, it was. It turned cold around Scranton, but I didn't even get off the bus. It's the truth. You can ask the driver."" It was ridiculous to stand before a group of strangers, denying my responsibility for the weather. But at the moment, the charges seemed entirely plausible."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","Amy Sedaris","00:10:32.43","""Well, it's supposed to clear up by tomorrow afternoon. But if it doesn't, I'll know where to find you. Right there, that's your trailer there, with the orange trim."""

"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","Amy Sedaris","00:10:53.52","I painted it myself, and the can said burnt orange. If it had said rust, I never would have bought it. It only looks rusty under those clouds you brought. Sunny day comes, and you'll see it's orange. I'm sorry I can't just rush out there and repaint it to meet your needs, your standards. But I've got other things to do."""
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:11:11.03","I asked where I might find a key to my trailer and heard a round of muffled laughter coming from the far corners of the room."

Maybe where you come from, people barricade themselves behind closed doors. But here, we have no reason. We don't lock our doors, because we have nothing to hide."""

In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:11:35.93","I walked up the gravel lane to my trailer, which had been sprayed with so much insecticide it curled the hairs in my nose.

The same pool I had seen in the brochure was now covered by a tarp, as was the hot tub. Even the flag was at half mast."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:12:14.42","I woke this morning to a fog so thick I couldn't see the picnic table in my front yard.

"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:12:25.68","Late last night, my water shut off. And it didn't kick in again until 8 o'clock this morning. I got dressed and went to the clubhouse, where I spoke to the woman at the front desk, who wore a turtleneck sweatshirt and drank cocoa from a mug she held with both hands."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","Amy Sedaris","00:12:38.13","""If you're here about the water, there's nothing I can do. We operate on wells, and sometimes they leak. It's a troublesome thing, a leaky well. So what we do, we shut down the pump around bedtime and turn it back on first thing in the morning."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","Amy Sedaris","00:12:50.40","Today, we got a late start. Most times, it's back on by 7:00, but Russell, handyman, didn't get back from his yoga class until close to 8 o'clock, on account of he threw out his shoulder doing some damn thing, whatever those people do tying themselves in knots in the presence of some yogi wearing a turban or god knows what, a loincloth-- I don't like to think about it while I'm drinking my cocoa."""
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:13:09.26","She reached beneath the counter and pulled out two marshmallows, which she stuffed into her mug."

And I looked out my window to see a naked couple strutting across the grounds with a pair of tennis racquets. The man wore his hair long in the back and carried himself as if he were dressed in a fine suit, his stride confident and purposeful, while the woman trotted behind him wearing a sun visor, knee socks, and sneakers."
"35","Fall Clearance Sale","1996-09-06","2","Act One. In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:13:41.14","These were the first active nudists I had seen. And I put on my pants and followed them, taking a seat beside the pavilion and pretending to read a book. The man had an ample stomach and a broad, dimpled ass which jiggled and swayed as he leapt about the court, attempting to return his partner's serves. They played for maybe five minutes before the man placed his hands on his knees, released a mouthful of bile onto the grass, and called it quits. They left the court, and I followed them into the clubhouse, where the man stepped into the bathroom, and the woman spoke to our hostess, who stood behind the counter, sorting change."

In the Nude","host","David Sedaris","00:14:37.54","The women had always been so cold to me but fell over herself making sure the married couple found everything to their liking. I heard the toilet flush, and the man re-entered the room with a bright red ring around his ass. Here, I thought, was a real nudist. And I stared at him as though he had just stepped down from a flying saucer. There was a tuft of toilet paper, just slight, clinging to his bottom. And when his wife pointed it out, he ran his hand along his crack and casually shrugged, as though it were nothing more significant than a dab of mayonnaise on his lips."

Yeah, we rent out whole place and have ourself a tournament. Oh, I can't race around a tennis court the way you can, but hand me a bowling ball, and I'll mop the floor with you. Hold on just a moment, will you? We've got ourselves a complainer standing in the back of the room. Well, what do you want?"""

Earlier today, I watched as a large trailer pulled up, marked with Maryland plates and led by a four-door late-model car. This was someone arriving to park their trailer and stay for the summer."

Then we just start pitching it at one another. And oh, it's a good time. Some good times, yeah. We can't do it this year. It attracted too many bees and files, which pretty much occupied the field for the next few months. But it was fun. I should let it go."

The coach was talking to the offense in the huddle, drawing on his sketch board, reprimanding somebody for screwing up the last play. We were standing around, waiting.

This is a posting from a Usenet group on the internet. It's one of these places where people post messages to each other. And this is from, I believe, the zoophilia group.

Grandma and Easy","host","Carmen Delzell","00:57:20.21","EZ played the guitar with my son for the rest of the night while the women talked and laughed in the kitchen. I couldn't help wondering if my grandmother had heard EZ's story. It's funny how Jesus was so important to both of them. But she always told me when I was little that there were two heavens, one for black people and one for white. I don't think so."
