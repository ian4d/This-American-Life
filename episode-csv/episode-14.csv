"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:28.54","A few years ago, I was putting together a story about a high school senior prom. And after the prom, I tagged along with two couples in a Ford Tempo, as they drove around, going to parties, talking, and joking, and singing along with the radio. We drove to pick up a friend of theirs at her house, but all the lights at her house were off, and nobody seemed at home."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","1","Prologue","subject","Girl 1","00:00:49.56","Wait, this isn't her house. This isn't her house."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","1","Prologue","subject","Girl 2","00:00:55.00","Yes, it is. Her car's right there."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","1","Prologue","subject","Girl 1","00:00:56.47","Really? I don't remember this being her house. Is it?"
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","1","Prologue","subject","Boy","00:01:02.13","You guys have been friends for such a long time, you don't even know where her house is, man."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","1","Prologue","subject","Girl 1","00:01:05.51","Hey, hey, this is her new house, all right?"
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","1","Prologue","subject","Boy","00:01:07.44","All right?"
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:09.62","A word now about doing documentary stories. When you're doing this kind of story, this is pretty much exactly the kind of moment that you dream of. Everybody's acting the way they act when there's no tape recorder present. It's intimate. It's alive."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:22.79","You feel like you're hearing these people as they really are even though there is a tape recorder and a boom microphone, a huge one, a foot and a half long, and a stranger. And to get to this point, you have to spend hours with people, get them used to you, get them to the point where they're actually bored with being recorded. And I tell you all this really only as a prelude to telling you this story."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:50.32","A while back, a guy named Joe Silovsky bought some old reel-to-reel tapes at a Salvation Army thrift store. And he took them home. And one of those tapes had exactly this quality tape on it, like in a really good documentary, that is, the people spoke the way that they really talk in real life. It was intimate. And it completely revealed what the people speaking were like."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:20.73","And hearing that tape gave us the idea for today's program, that we're going to devote the whole show to three stories made out of found tape like this. Accidental Documentaries, we call them."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:35.54","Act One takes place 30 years ago in Michigan. Act Two happens 40 years ago in my hometown, Baltimore. And Act Three happens 25 years ago here in Chicago. Stay with us."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","host","Ira Glass","00:02:56.71","Act One, Berrien Springs, Michigan. The tape that Joe Silovsky found is from 1967. It came in one of those boxes. I don't know if you remember these boxes that reel-to-reel tape came in in the '60s, and '70s, and '80s. And it fits two hours of tape. It's not that big. It's nine-inch reel of tape, two hours of tape."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","host","Ira Glass","00:03:19.31","And the box had stamps all over it, and addresses written, and crossed out, and written. And what it was was a letter on tape between this family in Michigan, the Davis family, and their son, Arthur, Junior, who was in medical school in Loma Linda, California. And the tape is interesting because it documents pretty thoroughly life in this one American family."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:03:48.00","Hello, son. There isn't much news. Grace was over one day. And she was feeling so bad about her marital situation. So I gave her this reality therapy book."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:04:01.30","And by the way, I sent you one, son. You'll be getting it in the mail soon. I had it sent right direct to you. It isn't that I think you need it. It's just a new insight on mental health, mental illness, that I think is good."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:04:17.35","I probably told you about the chapter I read to Jimmy when we were riding to Mrs. Lester's voice lesson. And it was a chapter on nagging. Smart wives don't have to nag. And it was so interesting. Halfway through it, I realized that this was written for me because I do nag quite a bit. And here, it brought out that sometimes a person nags because they want to feel superior."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:04:56.56","Each time they-- well, here, I'll read it, son. ""If you stop to think about it, you know perfectly well that this sort of nagging, that means nagging to get things done and things, isn't correcting the evil of what you complain. It's only making you feel important, virtuous, and superior. So for goodness sake, find some more constructive way of enhancing your feeling of virtue if it's so badly in need of being enhanced."""
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:05:31.79","Daddy has been very, very busy working in the basement. One of the machines is broken down. And true to form, it's taken him a long, long time to fix it. We're behind as usual on strips. Jack goofed, I guess, in his order of extrusions. And we are out of extrusions and won't be having them until Friday."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:05:54.77","I made $50 in one week and a half. That's when I bought-- I bought your suit, and paid my tithe, and things like this. Well, son, I'll say goodbye. But thank you for your words of advice as far as my resting. And thank you for being concerned about my welfare."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:06:10.40","I really have gotten along quite well recently. I didn't feel too bad of depression last month. Well, here I go. We'll see you again. And I'll let someone else talk on the tape. Bye-bye."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:06:23.26","Hello, Joe. How do you like this big tape anyhow? Isn't this pretty neat? I don't know if we ever get the thing filled up. And if we do get it filled up, I don't know whether you'll ever have the time to listen to it or not."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:06:36.09","Things are surely busy around here. They're really popping. I didn't get to bed 'til after 1 o'clock though. I was working downstairs, and I had work ready to take up to Jack's today, so we can get paid. We don't have any strips right now though. I guess I got a call for supper, so I'll come back later."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:06:55.95","I heard a little story that I thought I would tell you, Joe. Mom reminded me at the supper table. I just got back from eating supper. There were a couple out. They were getting acquainted, shall we say, doing a little French kissing. And the fella said, ""Oh, I think I got your gum."" And she said, ""No."" She said, ""I got a bad cold."" So I'll leave you with that little thought for the time being."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:07:39.46","Hi, Joe. I just got through talking to you on the phone. Little Kenny [? Jacques, ?] who I don't know if you remember him or not, but he's Quint [? Jacques's ?] oldest son, got married last March. And his girlfriend was here in school. And they were intending to keep it quiet until after school was out, but I guess he's pregnant now. So I suppose when you fool around, and do things like that, why, I suppose that's the price you're prepared to take. But I guess he's still in the Army."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:08:10.09","I saw him tonight in the drive-in. They look real happy together. She seems like a real nice little girl, almost too nice for him. He's a real nice fella, but he's quite mentally retarded, I think. At least, he may not be mentally retarded, but he has an awful time in school trying to figure out his ABC's. Anyway, that's the way it goes."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:08:34.31","And she seems to be real happy with him. She went with Carl Hamel before. And she seems like a good Christian girl. She's got one hand that's deformed. I suppose that makes her feel like it'd be awfully for her to get anybody. So she probably thought she'd take whatever she could get."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:09:03.13","It was interesting as we visited Aunt Menta and Uncle Wendall's this weekend. We just had a real nice time. But I felt a little odd about going and suggested in a very small way that Art ought to call Menta. But sometimes he gets real negative about my suggestions. And I realized that it's because many times I perhaps force myself on him. So I didn't say anything until about 50 miles before we got there."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:09:34.39","I really felt as though Menta should know we were coming. I should have written and told her. But I've left the communication with his family to Daddy. Well, he got a little bit vexed, and jumped out of the car, and went to the telephone, saying, ""I hope you're satisfied now."" But when he came back, Menta hadn't realized we were coming. And we were all grateful that we'd made the telephone call even though I didn't want to be right and say, ""I told you so."" Because it wouldn't have been nice to have walked in on them at a quarter to 10:00 at night."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:10:08.53","It was interesting how genuinely they accepted us. I don't know if I could be that gracious or not. Although they live such different lives. They had no plans for the weekend. We came. This was fine. And we ate what they had. And this was it."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:10:25.62","But I think of if the situation were reversed and Ment and Wendall dropped in on us, how many times we have company over the weekend, we have to go to functions, and we have music lessons, and things like this, and our lives are so completely different. It's interesting that we just spent all day sitting without doing anything at all. And this is so unusual for us. And even though I don't suppose I could do it every week, it did seem good for one week, just to sit, and look at each other, and talk. Ment and Wendall are sweet people really. It's very difficult for me not to judge a person's Christian experience."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:11:13.15","Darlene was voicing her experience last night. Art was a little bit perturbed because her skirt was too short. And Darlene was telling me that, really, she, in a way, resented Daddy's religion because it seemed to be so void of actual feeling and love. And I felt rather bad this morning. I got up to have my worship. I neglected it over the weekend."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:11:42.37","And I got up to have my worship. And as I did, Daddy came in and sat down beside me. And I felt rather funny because I really feel that he does this as a duty more than anything else. And when I have my worship, I feel communication with God, and I enjoy what I'm reading. And when Daddy came in, there was just a-- I don't know. I suppose you'd call it an inner resentment."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:12:15.49","I didn't know quite what to do. I was right in the middle of reading a chapter. So for the first time in my life, rather than to try to anticipate what he wanted and his needs, I just let him sit there. And I thought if he would say to me, ""Could I have worship with you?"" it would be fine. But he didn't. So I just continued reading and didn't say anything at all. He sat there for a little while, and then he left."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:12:53.48","Hi, Joe. That was sure nice to hear from you the other night. What I wanted to talk to you about tonight was I wanted to tell you about our power feed. This power feed that I made, we got that going now. So I got a hydraulic cylinder from Bimba, put that on there, and put some microswitches on there. And as the thing goes up, it pulls the chain around the sprocket."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:13:22.83","I think that if Daddy feels a spiritual lack and feels a need, then he, himself, ought to be the aggressive one and fulfill this need in his own way."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:13:35.29","So put that sprocket on there. And as the cylinder goes in, it pulls the chain that goes around the sprocket, it pulls it up and pushes the drill down."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:13:49.28","I would love to begin to have worship with Daddy, together, as husband and wife."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:13:54.97","And then when it gets to the other microswitch, why, it comes back. And as it comes back, we've got weights on the other side of the sprocket, pulling the chain in the other direction."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:14:03.35","We certainly have begun to enjoy many relationships that are very, very fulfilling in our marriage. But as far as this worship is concerned, it seems as though I'm always the one that has to make the initiative, plunge and say, ""Well, come, have worship with me,"" and select things that are inspiring. And I think this is wrong."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:14:27.85","And this new compressor works like a dream. It really is doing a good job for us, which makes us very happy. We're real happy with the results we're getting so far."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:14:38.43","I was reading an article last week, where we, so many times, try to fit people into our own pattern rather than to understand their background and appreciate their own pattern. And I think that he ought to fulfill his spiritual needs in his own way."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:14:59.66","Ken is going to come over. Ken Scholski. I don't know whether you know him or not. But he does real good at drilling the big holes. So he's going to come over and drill a couple hundred of the strips with the big holes for us. So we can at least get into production again by tomorrow night."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:15:15.58","Because I don't really know the depths of his spirituality and his basic needs."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:15:25.33","This one is practically foolproof, as long as we don't put too much air pressure on it and drive it too hard."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:15:30.12","So because I have no way of knowing, I'm going to stop worrying."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:15:34.57","We've been drilling some extrusions, 18-inch extrusions on the press with two holes at a time. It's been going pretty good."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:15:41.71","Daddy's calling, so bye-bye, son. And I'll see you later. I just had to tell you, son. Daddy screamed and hollered. You may have heard him over the tape, ""Honey!"" And I was right in the middle of a sentence to you, so I didn't go."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:15:53.16","But when I ran down, here, he has this power feed on. You know Daddy. He is very, very slow at what he does. And everyone has about lost their temper at him because they've tried so hard to be patient. And day by day, they've hoped this thing gets fixed."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:16:10.67","And so now I find this morning that he had fixed it. And this John that is working there was sitting there and working this just as easy as could be. And of course, everyone was really thrilled. And Daddy was so tickled. He was just as tickled as a little boy really."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:16:42.24","So son, we love you. We'll see you. I want to save some room here for your lady love. Good night."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:16:49.43","Well, son. I don't know who's talked."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:16:52.93","So son, we love you. We'll see you. I want to save some room here for your lady love. Good night."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:17:01.77","If I had the money, I would have called you tonight. It's funny. When you have an emotional problem, you don't quite know where to turn. They can say, ""Turn to the Lord."" And I think this is true. And yet, we're so human. We want human help."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:17:16.22","I just come back from taking a walk this evening, thinking, ""If I could just talk with someone."" And of course, you don't talk your problems out with too many people. And so I decided I'd turn the tape recorder on. And you could hear a negative [CLEARS HER THROAT]-- I'm trying to get a cold-- you could hear the negative side of the Davis household, which has been typical in the last few years."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:17:44.70","Here's Darlene. I could go on and on, and I know I must stop. Bye-bye, son."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Sister","00:17:49.30","Hi, Art. This week has really been a week, I tell you. I think it was Monday afternoon, I went into Mrs. Hare's office. And she told me that I would not be able to take my test because of my debit, which is $500-and-some. And that was very upsetting to me of course. I didn't realize I couldn't take my test for this."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:18:18.71","There's no excuse for this really other than that I can see for the first time she has money of her own. And it's the little things that she's bought. It seems good to just have money and spend it. And at the first of the year, she really probably didn't work quite as much as she should've. Regardless of what's gone over the dam, she's left with a $500 bill now. And well, naturally, we brought the problem to Daddy."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Sister","00:18:45.55","First, I talked with Dad about it. And he said he'd see what he could do. Well, he didn't do anything. There just seems to be no understanding at all there. But I guess that's to be expected, being what Daddy's like."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:19:02.16","When Darlene found this out from Mrs. Hare, she came home and cried an hour while I was teaching music lessons. And after the lessons, I went up and found out what the problem was. Naturally, she realizes her mistake. She's defeated. She doesn't know which way to turn. And I explained this to Art last night that she had realized that she made mistakes."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Mother","00:19:24.20","But goodness knows how many mistakes we've made in life. And as parents, if we could just help her pick up the pieces and somehow put them together again, so she wouldn't feel defeated, this would be so much more rewarding. But I also told him that I felt that we hadn't really helped you children too much with your schooling and that it seemed to me, and I'm sure you children felt the same way, that there were hundreds of dollars that goes into the basement. And I didn't really think it was right. Well, this he resented very much."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:20:10.30","Mom said she thought I ought to help her on this bill. But I don't know whether I'm wrong in this situation or not, but I feel in a way that she had this coming because she hasn't put in her full time. This last month she has. But up until that time, she's agreed for 12 hours a week, and it's been usually around-- oh, I imagine 5 to 6 hours is a lot closer to what's actually been accomplished. And then the money she does get, she's been spending on so many incidentals. And I kept talking and talking, but it didn't seem to do much good."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:20:48.24","But I feel it's better to provide a way for children to earn their education than it is to actually give them the money. And besides, we don't have the money. And if we weren't working down in the basement, why, there wouldn't be any money any more than there is right now. In fact, there wouldn't be as much. So I don't know."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:21:12.54","I guess I get mixed up in my philosophy and my thinking sometimes. And I know Darlene sometimes resents the fact that we don't give her more money. She sees all these other folks getting money, and she doesn't. I don't know exactly what to do about the situation. I don't know what's really right and what's wrong."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:21:41.89","But right now, I'm pretty strapped with all the taxes. I just had to pay $400 out at the first of the month. And now I come here again in the middle of the month and have to pay another $200."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Sister","00:21:57.58","Just a minute. Back again. Dad just came up to talk to me for a few minutes. I didn't know if I was going to work for him this summer or not after our little mix-up here. But I guess I'm going to work at the school and then in the afternoons for Dad because I have to pay off this debt just as soon as I can."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:22:24.09","Well, anyway, be that as it may, Rich told a story he was told about a little mama mouse that lived on the-- oh, there goes-- the thing is running downstairs now. I can hear it clicking-- told about a little girl mouse that lived on one side of the corn field. And the little boy mouse lived on the other side of the field. And one day, the little girl mouse in the autumn made a trip across the field. And when she got to the little boy's house, she said, ""Help, help, I've been reaped. I've been reaped."" They were reaping the corn."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","2","Act One. Berrien Springs, Michigan","subject","Father","00:23:00.55","And old Darlene just laughed and laughed. But she couldn't figure out what she was laughing at. The more she talked, the worse it got. She couldn't get the connection to the whole thing. See, she said, she thought it had something to do with emptying garbage or something. I don't remember just what her statement was. Anyway, it really made it quite funny. Her naiveness made it funnier than ever."

And we reached the former medical student, Arthur Davis, Junior, in his home in Indio, California, not far from Palm Springs. He practices family medicine. He actually makes house calls, he said, and has six kids of his own. And he told us that these letters on tape went back and forth between him and his parents for a period of about four years when he was away in California in medical school."

And he said that it was fine with him for us to play the tapes on the radio. He said that the tapes captured the dynamics of his family perfectly. The drama of a lot of American families is the emotional distance of the father, the father staying away from the family orbit, the father not being around, the father holding himself apart. And Arthur Davis, Junior says that his father was like a lot of American dads in that way and was, in fact, pretty removed."

But I have to say, the fact is, I never knew him as a radio deejay. I did not know that he had ever done radio the entire time I grew up. It was never discussed. The recordings of him doing this stuff were packed away in the basement. Nobody talked about it. I never thought of him as somebody who did anything but certified public accounting.

I could care less about radio. Like most Americans, my medium of choice was television. I got my first job with National Public Radio in Washington when I was 19 years old. And at that point, I simply wanted a job in the media. I was a freshman in college. If an ad agency had hired me that summer, right now, I would probably be doing Bud Light commercials.

It wasn't even a judgment call. They were completely against it for the next, I want to say, 10 years, maybe it was 15 years really. They simply saw it the way most parents would. They saw it as impractical. They worried that I would never make any decent money, never be able to support a family, essentially, the reasons that my father quit radio."

And before the show, he asked me if he could read the news. And at first, I thought he was joking. And I don't remember exactly what I said, but I joked something back at him. And then later, as we got closer to going on the air, he asked again that he would like to read the newscast, the NPR newscast at the top of the hour, at the beginning of the show. And I realized he was serious. And I had to explain to him that I didn't have any authority over that, that the NPR newscasters, they wrote their own news, and they delivered it themselves."

Lately, he's started saying that maybe I did not make such a mistake going into radio, that it seemed to be working out OK, which I'm glad for. I think one of the hardest things for any parent is to have one set of expectations for their children, and then be forced by their children to change them. That's really hard.

And partly, it was because of this culture clash. I was talking to him like an American girl, but he was born in Mexico. And in Spanish families, you never questioned your father. You never questioned your dad. In his mind, there was nothing more disrespectful than a child questioning the authority of her father."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","4","Act Three. Chicago","host","Nora Moreno","00:50:41.54","When my mother found out about the other woman, she couldn't believe it and didn't. He would tell her in that same beautiful voice that he still loved her. He persuaded her that she was imagining things, convinced her that there was no one else and could never be anyone else but her, all in that voice, that romantic, seductive, tempting voice that she had heard on the radio. Finally, after another one of their many fights, after months of continuous abuse, my mother took a gun and shot my father in the mouth."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","4","Act Three. Chicago","host","Nora Moreno","00:51:25.01","My dad survived the gunshot. And when the police came, he lied to them about what had happened, so they wouldn't take my mother to jail. He told them that he was teaching her to shoot when the gun went off. The cops didn't believe him, but he didn't want to press charges, and basically, there was nothing they could do. The strange thing is that, for a while, that whole experience brought them closer together. For a while."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","4","Act Three. Chicago","host","Nora Moreno","00:52:06.12","A couple of years ago, I decided to meet my father in Mexico. We were going to celebrate Father's Day together. I don't really know why we picked Father's Day. We both understood that being a father wasn't something he did very well. And when I think about it now, I can't remember a time in my life when I recognized that day. The point is that he didn't show up."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","4","Act Three. Chicago","host","Nora Moreno","00:52:31.18","It makes me sad because what I ended up doing was so much fun, and I knew he would have enjoyed himself too. I went to visit my uncle and cousins in Mexico City. We told stories, recited poetry, talked a lot about my dad. My cousin even brought out his guitar and tried to recite some of the poems my dad used to read. It was typical for my dad not to show up to things that included the family. Now that he's not really a part of it, it seems normal."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","4","Act Three. Chicago","host","Nora Moreno","00:53:23.17","My parents are divorced. My dad is in Texas, lonely and broke, dying of cancer. He's been out of radio for almost 20 years. When I talked to him on Monday and asked him about his poems, he couldn't remember the last time he had written one."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","4","Act Three. Chicago","host","Nora Moreno","00:53:39.69","I have a picture of my dad on a stage with the backdrop of a Spanish dancer and a big band surrounding him. There's a woman sharing the stage with him. She is elegant and stunning. She has this long, flowing evening dress. This woman is not my mother, but she captures my father. He's bowing at the waist. She holds out a hand to him, and he clasps it with both of his and kisses it, gazing up into her eyes with complete romantic concentration. His attention is for her alone."

"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","4","Act Three. Chicago","host","Nora Moreno","00:54:51.51","Well, it's my dad's favorite song. And he sort of took it on as a theme for his life."
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","4","Act Three. Chicago","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:55:02.17","Can you tell us why this would be his favorite song?"
"14","Accidental Documentaries","1996-02-21","4","Act Three. Chicago","host","Nora Moreno","00:55:04.31","Well, it talks about a man who has no place. And regardless of where he finds himself, he continues to be the king."
