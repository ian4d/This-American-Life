Number one, some of the language might not be suitable for younger listeners. Though, as you'll hear, we've beeped out the nastiest words. And, number two-- and usually I would never point something like this out-- you need to know that Dael is a woman, an African-American woman.

You're not paying attention, just absent-mindedly flipping through the letters and bills, and then, wham, some little surprise comes out of nowhere and changes your day."
"31","When You Talk About Music","1996-08-09","4","Act Four. A Life In Music","host","Sarah Vowell","00:39:56.08","I got this package. Inside was a letter, thanking me for mentioning the Fastbacks in a book review I had written, not from one of the Fastbacks themselves, mind you, just some guy in Chicago. His name was Scott Lee, and he'd enclosed this xerox booklet about the band."
"31","When You Talk About Music","1996-08-09","4","Act Four. A Life In Music","host","Sarah Vowell","00:40:14.68","Flipping through it, I stopped cold at something called, ""The Fastback's Drummers Pie Chart"". Since they formed in 1979, the Fastbacks have gone through about a dozen drummers. And this pie chart identifies the drummers by name, listing the percentage of songs which each one has contributed to. But, at the bottom of the page, small print warns, ""Note, Rusty and Nate's shares may not be totally accurate. Their percentages may be approximately 0.68% off."" And I don't think a decimal point had ever struck me as endearing before. The drastic exactitude of 0.68% sort of captured my heart, and I had to meet this person."
"31","When You Talk About Music","1996-08-09","4","Act Four. A Life In Music","subject","Scott Lee","00:40:59.73"," Basically, it has your standard discography. And then there's just some facts here that I dug out, 139 total songs, eight hours, 25 minutes, 43 seconds worth of songs."
"31","When You Talk About Music","1996-08-09","4","Act Four. A Life In Music","host","Sarah Vowell","00:41:14.83","So he showed me other stats, like total recorded versions of songs, total number of seconds of songs, which is 30,343, in case you were wondering."

And, normally, as a music lover and as a woman, I rail against the mostly-male, record-collector geek habit of reducing rock and roll to baseball card collecting. They flatten out this complex, thrilling thing down to manageable lists of names and titles and dates."
"31","When You Talk About Music","1996-08-09","4","Act Four. A Life In Music","host","Sarah Vowell","00:41:56.45","But Scott Lee's Fastbacks tribute has the devotional fervour of a medieval illuminated manuscript. The list of facts and figures is so relentless and exact and painstaking that it takes on this liturgical glow, as if the Fastbacks were a religion and Scott Lee its prophet."
"31","When You Talk About Music","1996-08-09","4","Act Four. A Life In Music","subject","Scott Lee","00:42:15.86"," But some of the new additions to this-- as I ramble here-- listed out the songs A through Z and did the percentages of songs starting with each letter. And the letter that won was I. There were 19 Fastback songs that started with I, representing about 14% of the songs. With every album, they seem to have a song that starts with, ""In"", like, ""In America"", ""In The Summer"", ""In The Winter"", ""In The Observatory""."
"31","When You Talk About Music","1996-08-09","4","Act Four. A Life In Music","host","Sarah Vowell","00:42:46.81"," I soon found out that the band has befriended Scott Lee and that they've sort of informally appointed him their de-facto archivist. Singer Kim Warnick corresponds with Scott via email, sometimes, like four times a day. Guitarist and songwriter, Kurt Bloch, graciously calls him ""A good person to have on our team."" Though, when he first saw Scott Lee's packet, he had some understandable worries."
"31","When You Talk About Music","1996-08-09","4","Act Four. A Life In Music","subject","Kurt Bloch","00:43:12.82"," Ah! I mean, it was like, boy. The first thing that would come to my mind is, is this guy really scary? Is he the kind of person I would run away from, if he was ever in the same room? Is this the kind of person that I would stop answering my telephone if he called? And, no, it's not. Not to make you think that we don't think Scott Lee is actually fairly crazy of a person, but he's not the annoying kind of crazy person that you read about. And I think he appreciates his own over-the-top-ness."
"31","When You Talk About Music","1996-08-09","4","Act Four. A Life In Music","host","Sarah Vowell","00:43:54.09"," If anything, the Fastbacks are a little protective of Scott Lee. When I was talking to Kurt, I jokingly called Scott his stalker. But he set me straight."
"31","When You Talk About Music","1996-08-09","4","Act Four. A Life In Music","subject","Kurt Bloch","00:44:04.57"," No, he's not a stalker. He's a super-fan."

"31","When You Talk About Music","1996-08-09","4","Act Four. A Life In Music","host","Sarah Vowell","00:44:15.72"," Like the super-fan, the members of the Fastbacks all have day jobs. So, on any given day, it's possible that Scott is devoting more energy to being a fan than the Fastbacks devote to being in the band. When I interviewed Kim, the gaping differences between being a band member and being a super-fan were never clearer."

And I was walking across a very icy, cold midway in Buffalo. And, despite how cold it was, when I listened to this music, it really just pumped all this life into me. It was really a life-affirming experience, as corny as that might sound. But, I don't know, I was just really happy at that point. And it was just a light on me that shown.

"31","When You Talk About Music","1996-08-09","4","Act Four. A Life In Music","host","Sarah Vowell","00:47:26.88"," In fact, Scott's spare time is limited. He holds down a full-time job at a Chicago advertising agency, and he writes his own songs. And, truthfully, he flirts with the idea of not staying a fan. He's moving to Seattle, partly to be closer to the Fastbacks. He's actually in their circle of friends now. And he's tried a couple of times to start his own band."

Back when Sam began, accordion was huge, huge. Every band in Chicago had an accordionist doing their keyboards because pianos, in those days, were so impractical, you know? You can't carry them around. The one that you find at the hall is always out of tune."

He can lecture you for a long time on how it's not in the symphony orchestra. Basically, in his view, America's 40-year love affair with the guitar is a concerted effort to slap back at the accordion."

And they said, we're not going to play it, you know? We're going to play something different. And there it was. It just came out as a rebel cause, I think. It only has five notes, a set of six strings. Two are the same, so it brings it down to five notes, you know? You have to hit it with a pick. You've got to use two hands to make one note. Does that make sense? Why would you want to do that? Why would you want to use two hands to make one note?"
