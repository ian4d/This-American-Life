"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","1","Prologue","subject","Andrea Defotis","00:00:07.10","This is my detective book. I would go to the library and get all these books out on the FBI, take notes, learn words."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:00:18.36","So this book, just to describe it, it's an old, loose-leaf notebook with 1960s-era flowers all over it and stickers all over the cover."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","1","Prologue","subject","Andrea Defotis","00:00:27.66","Really tacky stickers."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:38.46","How many of us today have had a moment where we entertained that dream of being a private eye, of being Kojak or Columbo or Rockford or-- there are just so many. Well, I'm Ira Glass. And, of course, every week on this program we bring you a variety of stories documenting every day life in these United States. And on today's program, we're going to hear a number of stories about people who want to be detectives, adults and children."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:05.64","And we'll begin with one of the purest expressions of this desire you could possibly find. And that is a child's handmade detective notebook. Andrea DeFotis brought it in. And one of the things that's interesting about it-- and I think this is probably a typical problem for many armchair, wannabe detectives-- is that it records her desire to gather clues and solve cases. But sadly for her, she was leading a life where there were really not that many cases to be solved."

The things inside Solved and the unsolved stuff, they're exactly the same. There's a section on how to secretly code messages. There's the record of a successful case where Andrea found her sister's necklace, a very tough case. It was on the ground, behind a bureau."

"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","1","Prologue","subject","Andrea Defotis","00:03:11.50","I guess to be sneaky, or to be a detective or part of the FBI club, something like that.

"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:04:20.97","It asks if you've ever had an alias. 11-year-old Andrea wrote, ""Yes, Peanut,"" her nickname at the time.

"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","2","Act One. Wannabe","host","Ira Glass","00:08:34.18","Act One, Wannabe. Detectives are just one of those things, like amnesia, or asteroids hitting earth, or talking animals, or seven-year-olds with the wisdom of adults, one of those things that just seems to occur a lot more in the movies then they ever do in real life. But I suppose so many things fall into that category. Why detective stories, though?"
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","2","Act One. Wannabe","host","Ira Glass","00:09:01.31","Somebody once said-- and I would agree with this-- that every good story is a detective story, meaning every good story in any genre raises some big question at the beginning, some thing that we want to find out. And then the process of the story, the reason why we keep reading or watching is that we just want to know. We want to know what is going to happen. What is the thing? We want the answer."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","2","Act One. Wannabe","host","Ira Glass","00:09:23.50","Mysteries are just the purest form of this. They offer the satisfaction of this kind of story in the purest possible way. The question couldn't be clearer. There's a crime. Who did it? And by the end, all is revealed. Light is shed. We know the answer."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","2","Act One. Wannabe","host","Ira Glass","00:09:37.67","So they're hard to resist. The problem, of course, is if you see so many detective stories, if you read so many, see so many TV shows, that you start believing that you can actually do what the fictional characters in the shows are able to do. We have this story from writer David Sedaris about his own family."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","2","Act One. Wannabe","host","David Sedaris","00:09:57.75","My mother had a thing for detectives, be they old, blind, or paralyzed from the waist down, she just couldn't get enough. My older sister shared her interest. Detective worship became something they practiced together, swapping plot lines the way other mothers and daughters exchanged recipes or grooming tips."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","2","Act One. Wannabe","host","David Sedaris","00:10:17.95","One television program would end and the next one begin, filling our house with the constant din of gunfire and squealing tires. Downstairs, the obese detective would collect his breath on the bow of the drug lord's pleasure craft, while up in the kitchen, his elderly colleague hurled himself over a low brick wall in pursuit of the baby-faced serial killer. ""How's your case coming?"" my mother would shout during commercial breaks. Cupping her hands to the side of her mouth, Lisa would yell, ""Tubby's still tracking down leads, but I'm betting it's the Chinesey guy with the eye patch and the ponytail."""
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","2","Act One. Wannabe","host","David Sedaris","00:10:58.41","Theirs was a world of obvious suspects. Looking for the axe murderer? Try the emotionally disturbed lumberjack loitering near the tool shed behind the victim's house. Who kidnapped the guidance counselor? Perhaps it's a 30-year-old 10th grader with a gym bag full of bloody rope."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","2","Act One. Wannabe","host","David Sedaris","00:11:19.15","It was no wonder these cases were solved so quickly. Every clue was italicized with a burst of surging trumpets. And under questioning, the suspects snapped like toothpicks, buckling in less time than it took to soft boil an egg."

"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","2","Act One. Wannabe","host","David Sedaris","00:11:48.05","It's easy to solve a case where none of the suspects were capable of telling a decent lie. It seemed that anyone could solve a murder, just so long as they had a telephone, a few hours of spare time, and a wet bar. My mother had all three ingredients. The more suspects she identified over the course of a season, the more confident she became."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","2","Act One. Wannabe","host","David Sedaris","00:12:10.29","Together, she and my sister would comb the local newspaper, speculating on each reported crime. ""We know that the girl was held at knifepoint on the second floor of her house,"" Lisa said, tapping a pencil against her forehead. ""So probably, the person who robbed her was not in a wheelchair."""
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","2","Act One. Wannabe","host","David Sedaris","00:12:31.59","""I'd say that's a pretty safe assumption,"" my mother answered. ""While you're at it, I think we might as well eliminate anyone confined to an iron lung. Listen, Sherlock, you're going at it all wrong. The guy broke in, held her at knifepoint, and made off with $300 in cash, right?"" ""And a clock radio,"" Lisa said. ""$300 and a clock radio."""
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","2","Act One. Wannabe","host","David Sedaris","00:12:50.98","""Forget the clock radio,"" my mother said. ""The important thing is that he used a knife. All right now, what kind of a person uses a knife?"" Lisa guessed that it might have been a chef. ""Maybe she was at a restaurant, and the cook noticed she had a lot of money in her pocketbook."""
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","2","Act One. Wannabe","host","David Sedaris","00:13:08.32","""Right,"" my mother said, ""because that's what cooks do, isn't it? They crawl around the dining room floor, looking through purses, while the food sits in the kitchen, cooking itself. Come on now, think. Who uses a knife to commit a crime? In a world of guns, what kind of person would use a knife? Give up? It's just two little words, drug addict. It's just that simple. A professional thief would use a gun. But even a second-hand gun costs money. A drug addict can't afford a gun. They need all their money for their dope and smack, the hard stuff. These dopers have a habit to feed every minute of every day, which means they're always on the lookout for their next mark. This was a heroin addict who followed the girl home from the bank, parked his car around the corner, broke into the house, and robbed her at knifepoint."""

""Screw the damn clock radio,"" my mother said. ""And as for the car, it was stolen. He took it last Thursday from that couple on Pamlico. You saw the report in the paper, the brand new Ford Mustang, remember? You thought it'd been stolen by gypsies. And I said we don't even have gypsies in this part of the country. I said the car had been taken by a dope addict who'd use it for a couple of burglaries before selling it to a chop shop. Bingo, there you have it."""

Wannabe","host","David Sedaris","00:14:45.57","Vandalism at 318 Poole Road, breaking and entering at the Five Points Pharmacy, a hit and run traffic accident in the parking lot of Swain Steakhouse. It was always the work of a drug addict or a former police officer, a renegade, a rogue. To hear my mother talk, you'd think the sunny, manicured streets of suburban Raleigh were crawling with heroin addicts, the needles poking through the sleeves of their tattered police uniforms."

We were well into our summer reruns when our household was shaken by a series of very real crimes no TV detective could ever hope to crack. Someone in our family had taken to wiping their ass on the bath towels."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","2","Act One. Wannabe","host","David Sedaris","00:18:02.64","What made this exceptionally disturbing was that all of our towels were fudge-colored. You'd be drying your hair when too late, you'd notice an unmistakable odor on your hands, head, and face. If nothing else, life in the suburbs promised that one might go from day to day without finding stool samples in their hair. This sudden turn of events tested our resolve to the core, leaving us to wonder who we were and where we, as a people, had gone wrong."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","2","Act One. Wannabe","host","David Sedaris","00:18:31.59","Soul searching aside, it also called for plenty of hot water, gallons of shampoo, steel wool, industrial scrub brushes, and blocks of harsh, deodorizing soap. The criminal hit all three bathrooms, pausing just long enough to convince the rest of us that it was finally safe to let our guard down. I might spend 20 minutes carefully sniffing the towel, only to discover that this time, they'd used to washcloth."

It might prove difficult to roll over grass and leaves, so I imagined them huddled in the carport, deciding it best to stick to the roads and sidewalks."

There was nothing I could say to change his mind. Falsely convicted of a crime I didn't commit, there was only one thing I could do. The shoe polish was kept in the linen closet. I chose black."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","2","Act One. Wannabe","host","David Sedaris","00:23:57.62","The Fugitive's hair always looked perfectly natural. It blew in the breeze created by oncoming trucks as he stood beside the lonesome road, bidding farewell to a town unable to appreciate his unique gifts.

My face and arms were bruised-looking, and everything stank with the rigid, military odor of a buffing rag. It was no wonder the Fugitive was a loner.

"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:47:16.27","Yeah, I know. But from moment to moment, don't you feel like you decide, ""Yes, she must be. No, no, she can't be. Yes, she must be. No, she can't be""?"
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","subject","Jonathan Rosenberg","00:47:21.83","Not 'til I see it."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:47:23.83"," Come on."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","subject","Jonathan Rosenberg","00:47:26.57"," See, this is the clinch. This is the clinch right now. Because we know what we're here to find out is inside there. And I know the answer's inside, so why start guessing? I could just walk inside and tell you what the answer is."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","host","Ira Glass","00:47:45.34","And so we head into the restaurant. Jonathan leaves his cameras and his notepads in the car. I leave my tape recorder. Jonathan says we'd be too conspicuous with that stuff."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","host","Ira Glass","00:47:58.43","And when we walk in, we're pretty much convinced that she is meeting girlfriends from work, just like she told her husband. So we go in. And we spot her right away in a booth with a man."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","host","Ira Glass","00:48:19.11","The way the restaurant is laid out, we can sit at the bar with our back to the couple and then watch everything they do in this big, plate glass mirror that's behind the bar. They don't serve Cherry Diet Coke at this bar. So Jonathan orders a regular Diet Coke. And we sit there."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","host","Ira Glass","00:48:39.29","His cell phone rings. And it's the woman's husband. Jonathan gives him the news this way. He says, very quietly, ""Apparently, your suspicions were correct."" The husband gets angry, which Jonathan says is unusual. For some reason, men in this situation, when they get this news, usually cry. Women get angry, in Jonathan's experience."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","host","Ira Glass","00:49:03.03","I watch the couple in the mirror. She's telling the guy a story, gesturing with her hands. He laughs. And I think, ""You have no idea what's about to hit you."""
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","host","Ira Glass","00:49:25.87","I watch. Someday, that woman's going to look back on this night. And she'll think, ""So when I drove to the restaurant, when I was driving there, I was being followed. When we sat talking that night, we were being watched. And I didn't know."""
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","host","Ira Glass","00:49:45.86","She'll try to picture it, put it together in her mind. Where was the detective? Where did he wait? Where did he sit? What did he see her do?"
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","host","Ira Glass","00:49:59.83","In the mirror, Jonathan and I watch the woman get a call on her cellular phone. And she pulls back a little bit from the man who she's with and withdraw into herself a little bit, talks on the phone. And we wonder, is that her husband? Is he just messing with her?"
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","host","Ira Glass","00:50:17.37","She talks and hangs up. 30 seconds later, Jonathan's cell phone rings. It was him. He was messing with her."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","host","Ira Glass","00:50:29.87","He's like, ""So, are you out with the girls? Uh-huh. Where are you guys. Yeah, who's there? What are you guys talking about?"" ""That lying bitch,"" he said to Jonathan. For some reason, it's hard at this moment to feel much sympathy for him."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","host","Ira Glass","00:50:56.95","I have to tell you about the strangest thing about this entire scene. And that is that there's no sex vibe between these two people. In fact, the man is shoveling food in his mouth with a kind of circular motion of his hand that is the least sexy thing possible. It's just crude."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","host","Ira Glass","00:51:16.26","You watch him, and you think, ""She is not going to bed with you, if you're going to eat like that."" And in fact, when they come out of the restaurant, they go their separate ways without even a kiss, without a hug. Jonathan snaps a few pictures of them outside."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","subject","Jonathan Rosenberg","00:51:33.91","Is that him? Yeah."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","host","Ira Glass","00:51:38.31","We follow the guy home, get his license plate numbers, get his address. It's an unusual case, because 90% of the time, Jonathan says, when somebody suspects the spouse of having an affair, the detective catches them the first time out. This case, he's not very sure what's going on. He follows the woman for five more days, over $1,000 worth of surveillance, before finally, he catches her actually going home with the guy. In the car, later, I ask him if his job ever gives him the creeps, following people around, secretly watching them in these vulnerable moments, photographing them and videotaping them, gathering evidence that will probably destroy their marriages."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","subject","Jonathan Rosenberg","00:52:20.59","Well, that's always upsetting. You never really want to see that happen to people. But if it came to be that way, it did. It was through no fault of my own."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","subject","Jonathan Rosenberg","00:52:35.50","And these people made their decision to partake in the activities they chose to partake. And if they're not being faithful to each other, then maybe they really shouldn't be married. It's that old saying. It's better to find out now than later."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","subject","Jonathan Rosenberg","00:53:03.20","[PHONE RINGS]"
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","subject","Jonathan Rosenberg","00:53:05.56","Hello? I should be home about 9:30, 10 o'clock. But if I'll be home later, I'll call you. OK. Love you, too. Bye. That's the wife."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","host","Ira Glass","00:53:18.77","Jonathan's actually a newlywed. He's been married for only eight months. And he says, yes, having this job has affected his view of marriage."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","subject","Jonathan Rosenberg","00:53:26.41","How can it not? You're more careful about it, because you see it. But it really hasn't affected me in a negative way with my relationship with my wife."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:53:37.04","You were saying when we were inside that you guys joke about it, in fact."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","subject","Jonathan Rosenberg","00:53:39.49","Oh yeah, we do, we do. If I ask her, ""What time are you going to be home?"" And then she'll be like, ""Well, I'm not going to tell you. I got to go meet my boyfriend."" And we're like, ""All right. That's all right. I'll find it out anyways. I know it anyways, you don't need to tell me."" Like I have a surveillance or a tail on her at that minute anyways. But we have a really good relationship."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","host","Ira Glass","00:54:04.47","As for me, for the next few days after the surveillance, I had this experience I have never had in my life. I was completely suspicious of everyone. At one point, I was waiting for somebody outside a McDonald's. And a guy in a black Corolla zooms in, just tears into the parking lot, tears around the curve, pulls into a space."
"28","Detectives","1996-07-12","3","Act Two. The Real World","host","Ira Glass","00:54:29.35","And I don't know why, I felt like, ""OK. I better start taking notes."" I have them, right here. ""Man wore sunglasses, has crew cut. Loud music blares from car. Jumps out, beefy guy, gives me suspicious look. I give him suspicious look."" And then below here, on the notes, I have his license plate number, just in case."
