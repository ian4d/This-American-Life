"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:40.83","And weeks went by. And months went by. And then one day, she and a coworker were in the mail room at the extremely low-level office jobs that they held, and there amongst the envelopes, stacks of envelopes everywhere, they started talking. And that's where it happened to Evan Harris."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:07.20","You know how sometimes the smallest thing can end up changing your entire life? A casual comment by somebody that you barely know, an ad you happen to spot in the newspaper, a chance encounter, one little moment. And later when you look back, you realize, oh, that was it. That was the moment. That was the pivot point around which my entire life turned and spun and went into a totally different direction. And you know you don't get to choose. You do not get to choose this pivotal moment. And sometimes, as anybody over a certain age can tell you, the pivotal moment can be kind of stupid."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:57.81","In Evan Harris's case, it was about as unlikely as they come."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","subject","Evan Harris","00:02:02.55","We were doing some sort of menial labor. She was doing a mailing, and I was putting some stuff in alphabetical order. And I said to her, ""Shouldn't the letter Q be further toward the back of the alphabet?"""

"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:03:22.12","So Evan Harris and her friend and coworker, Shelley Ross, were at this job and they started talking about the letter Q. And it was the kind of conversation you can only really have at a job that does not require total concentration. So you're sorting mail, you're frying burgers, you're doing whatever. And so they're talking about the letter Q."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:03:44.64","And again, remember, this is the pivotal conversation in a person's life. They're talking about the letter Q and they get to talking about where it should be in the alphabet. And in their minds, Q does not belong in the middle of the alphabet where it is, with the hoi polloi of the alphabet. Your Ms, your Ns, your Ps. Letters that will just join any word for the asking. N is in letters-- you don't even hear it. Damn. What's it doing in there?"
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:04:16.02","Q, in their mind, has more character. Q, in their mind, doesn't take anything off of anybody. It makes demands and it sees that they are met. What other letter has an adjunct, a bodyguard with it, carried into every word? In their mind, Q belongs at the end of the alphabet, with your Xs, your Ys, your Zs. Letters that do not care what anybody thinks of them and that don't just join up to any word."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:04:44.94","And Q, of course, is the first letter of the word ""quit."" You can't spell ""quit"" without Q, at least on public radio you can't. And Evan Harris and her friend Shelley Ross started talking about what it means to be able to quit something. What are the qualities that you need? And they decided the qualities were that kind of fierce independence that, in fact, they saw in the letter Q. And they talked about quitting for a long time that day."

The point is we cannot choose who we fall in love with. We cannot choose what we are interested to write about. We cannot choose our muse."

I don't know how much you have quit, but there is an incredible charge to quitting that is like a drug. It's like being in love kind of, except it's being in love with your decision."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:08:30.96","Evan Harris was writing about quitting, and thinking about quitting, and gathering the strength to quit her job and her boyfriend and her city, which, by the way, she did. And at some point in this entire process, her view of the world began to change. Quits and potential quits seemed to be everywhere. She would go out with a friend for coffee and, of course, talk about all this quitting business that she was thinking about all the time. And then this friend, no matter who it was, would come out with some story about something that he or she wanted to quit. Quitting started to seem like the engine that made everything in the world go round."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","subject","Evan Harris","00:09:11.18","The way I see it in thinking about my own life, I see it as being framed and the narrative of it being pushed along by quitting, by quits. So that my first big quit was to leave the college that I was going to, and I moved to New York City. And then my next big quit was to quit the graduate program that I was in, and then I fell into this job. And so now I have nothing left to quit. I mean I've quit my boyfriend. I've quit my city. I've quit my job. And I have nothing left to quit. And so really now there's nothing to do but build things up again. Do you see what I mean?"
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:09:51.64","Yeah, but you say that as if you're just building them up for what will be the central fact of your life, which is then you're going to quit them."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","subject","Evan Harris","00:09:58.70","That's right. The way I see it is that there's sort of like two basic, big, important concepts. OK? And the first one is that nothing lasts forever. There is nothing that you can do that you can keep on doing forever. Nothing. That's it. Period. End of story. And then the other big one is that you have to be doing something. So my feeling is it's better to willfully quit whatever it is and then go on to the next thing that you have to be doing, because you have to be doing something, than to just kind of let things fall apart."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","subject","Evan Harris","00:10:41.70","The quitting cycle. In everybody's life, there is something of a quitting cycle. So you can talk about adolescence being a time where people quit listening to their parents. And then maybe in people's mid-to-late 20s, they start quitting places or even quitting people. And then later on in mid-life, I think that there's a little bit of a quitting thing going on, which some people call mid-life crisis, and I would probably call it the mid-life quit. And then for older adults, I think they do quite a bit of quitting, too. I think that they basically quit giving a damn what people think of them and quit worrying about certain things."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","subject","Evan Harris","00:11:33.07","There's the quitting cycle and then there's the nature of quitters, which I think is important. I don't think quitters are lazy people necessarily. I mean some quitters are probably lazy, but I don't think that the essential nature of a quitter is to be lazy. I think that the essential nature of a quitter is to be able to cut their losses and move on. Quitting is about being willful. Quitting is about having one's own volition to do whatever."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:12:09.11","Can I ask you to reflect on why it is that you think the word ""quitter"" has such a pejorative connotation in our culture? Because I think of the last time I saw the word ""quitter"" and it was a cover of a magazine with Ross Perot on it, when he pulled out of the presidential race. And the word ""quitter"" was above him. Just the notion of being a quitter was so shameful. That was the message of it."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","subject","Evan Harris","00:12:34.38","The word ""quitter"" does have a negative connotation, and that's something that I would really like to change. I would really like to kidnap that word. I see quitters as people who have volition. Quitters never win and winners never quit, and that's completely untrue. I mean really the more things you quit, the more things you're going to do. And the more things you do, the more potential you have for success."

The anatomy of a quit. The quitter thinks about it. Step two now. The quitter thinks about it some more. To me this indicates somebody who actually has been in that position. You don't just think about it. It goes on for a really long, long time before you actually then do the quit. Let's review."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","subject","Evan Harris","00:14:12.06","That the quitter thinks about it. The quitter thinks about it some more. The quitter quits. And then there's the post-quitting stuff."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:14:26.05","Now, you know, we have all met in our lives people who have come to see the world through a single idea, people for whom all interaction can be explained by some scheme. And it could be a big idea. It could be the laws of supply and demand, or Fundamentalist Christianity, or structuralist linguistic theory. Or it could be a small idea. The need for everybody to do aerobic exercise on a regular basis, or the danger of fluoridation, or CIA conspiracies dating back to the Bay of Pigs."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:15:02.91","Who amongst us has not had a conversation on a train, or a plane, or at a party, or an in-law's house, where some earnest-faced person, full of evidence and theory, expounds at length on an idea like, if everyone on the earth would just stand on his or her head for an hour a day, there would be world peace?"
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:15:30.78","And if you talk to Evan Harris for a while, she'll tell you about the great quits which have driven world history, how, in fact, all the wars and strife of the millennia are, in fact, better understood as a series of quits. And as some people will do when they become obsessed with a single topic, she sometimes delves into quitting issues that are so esoteric, so erudite, that it would be hard, I think, for anyone else to not just understand them, but to care about them."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:16:06.11","For example, she was trying to figure out a system for how to rate the importance of various types of quits. She actually created a mathematical model to do that that she was working on. And during our interview, she repeated several times that quitting had a life of its own, a life separate from any of the quits that you might make or I might make or other people make. In her mind, it seemed that quitting-- was almost like a living thing, separate from the actions of human beings."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","subject","Evan Harris","00:16:43.73","Quitting itself has an identity, and your particular quit, one quitter's particular quit, fits into the world and all the other quitters in the world. And you have to remember that your quit is going to influence another person's quit, potentially. The point of quitting is to move in the world and to get bigger and bigger as a person. God damn. Sometimes I just start to sound like a nut basically about this. I mean, what am I talking about? What am I talking about? You have to understand. This is so on my mind. I think about this all the time. I think about this all the time. I'm thinking about getting up and walking out of this room right now. I really am."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","subject","Evan Harris","00:17:46.48","Quitting is not just about how it feels to yourself. No, I don't think that's true. I don't think that's true. And I think that people have to see themselves in a swim that way."

"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:18:14.06","Evan, I have to say that you're saying people should be aware of themselves as being part of a world of quitting, and a world of people who are quitting, and a whole idea of the notion of quitting. But I have to say, in all of my life, you are the only person I've ever met who thinks of it that way."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","subject","Evan Harris","00:18:29.93","Oh, but you're so wrong about that. Oh well, maybe you're not wrong. Am I really the only person you've ever met who thinks of quitting in this way?"

"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:18:53.49","I wonder how long you're going to feel this way, how long you're going to be this interested in quitting."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","1","Prologue","subject","Evan Harris","00:19:03.03","I don't know how long I'll be interested in quitting. I think maybe what you're suggesting is that I'll get it out of my system and I'll be over it and it'll be done. But as I said before, I have quit everything. I don't, in a very literal way, have anything to quit anymore. I have no city. I have no boyfriend. I have no home. Not that those are the only things in life. I mean, I suppose I could quit smoking or quit eating things that are bad for me. There's a lot of little quits that I could execute which I might do just to tide me over. But the thing about quitting is that it runs on a cycle so that now or soon-- not quite yet-- but soon, I'll be building more things up which I will quit."

My eyes like their lids shut. Blindness would hinder my motion. My arms and legs remembered the heavy metal burned into their sense memory and refused me the grace I needed to get through the day. My body's refusal to function was in the name of survival. If I moved, that meant I would get up. If I got up, I would probably take a shower and get dressed. If I did that, I would go to work, to unspeakable, unthinkable horror."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","4","Act Three","host","Lisa Buscani","00:42:13.18","Now, don't get me wrong. I have nothing against work per se. The concept of joining shoulder-to-shoulder with efficient, enthusiastic coworkers, discovering problems, crafting solutions, pushing onward, always onward via honest sweat of brow is attractive to me. I think of well-constructed women in business suits, the ones who really know how to tie a scarf, dashing through airports to catch that last flight to Rome, manhandling a potential empire crashing crisis, and spending an exhausted yet satisfied overnight in the company pensione."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","4","Act Three","host","Lisa Buscani","00:42:50.42","I think of post office murals and 1950's communist propaganda. Strong, textured, geometric men in the stoic blue of the overall and the work shirt, reverently folding open the land, courageously braving the hell of the forge, lifting their ruddy cheeks and angular chins to God or government, simply, deeply, thankful for their job. That was work to me, not the salaried conflagration I went to every day."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","4","Act Three","host","Lisa Buscani","00:43:21.37","I worked at a small trade journal in the suburbs where I handled various layout and writing tasks. It was a tiny firm, a mom and pop organization, if you will, starring Leona Helmsley as mom. The publisher was a shrunken, shrewish woman in her 50's, the kind of woman who thought the word ""broad"" was a badge of honor. She fancied herself the last of the old Chicago newsies, barking her wisdom from her stuffy, windowless office, her cover sticks sweating off the gin blossoms in her nose, one of an endless supply of beige stained Virginia Slims dangling from her lipless mouth."

It was as if Satan had made a foray into human resources. She stood over my shoulder constantly, criticizing my work with raptorial fervor, waiting like a blood-mouthed hyena for the moment when I tripped up and made an error. And when I did screw up, as employees inevitably do when told they can do nothing else, she was all over me like drone bees to the queen. I was not capable of being right. The presumption that I could be right, that I could even have an opinion, infuriated her. Any argument I sputtered in my defense was dissected, mocked, and negated. After all, how can one question the wisdom of a woman who cornered the floral industry tabloid market? It was better to tip my neck open and let her drink."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","4","Act Three","host","Lisa Buscani","00:44:58.86","As horrible as it was, I couldn't just leave. She paid me $12,000 a year. Even with a second job on weekends, I barely got by. I rarely went out anywhere. I felt like restaurants were meant for other people. The world seemed to narrow to the places where I could and could not go. My friends nicknamed me Florence Nightingale. No one could nurse a drink like I could. I bought the cheapest food possible, the cheapest clothes available, and forgot about cutting my hair. My thought process was consistently reduced to the bottom line. Basically, the job taught me one thing-- how to live a life with little or no option. And after a while, I was incapable of imagining myself in any other circumstance. Forget about my college degree and all the experience I obtained. This was how it was and always would be. If you thought about it too much, it became hard to breathe."
"7","Quitting","1995-12-29","4","Act Three","host","Lisa Buscani","00:46:03.19","The breaking came when review time rolled around, two months later than she said it would when she hired me. She told me she wasn't going to give me a raise. Raises were given on merit in her office, she said. My work did not merit a raise. The room was suddenly very literally light. It was almost too bright in the room to look at her without wincing. I could hear the hum of the office lamps. I was amazed at my calm. I stood, walked to my desk, took my office keys off the chain, and walked out the door."

I didn't mind the pain. Peace is a fine travelling companion."
