"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","host","Ira Glass","00:00:01.15","Well, in this moment of our presidential election process, let us consider the plight of a group whose sad fate we do not usually consider, a group we do not usually count among society's victims. I refer to moderate Republicans, because they have seen the future. And the future has a name. And the future's name is Bob Dole, the man now invariably referred to as the presumptive nominee, except of course by himself. He always refers to himself as Bob Dole."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","host","Ira Glass","00:00:41.06","And they are a pragmatic, roll up your sleeves, get the job done group, as a whole, the moderate Republicans are. And they will do what is necessary for victory in the fall to get the White House. But just last week, when we convened a small, unscientific panel of four Republicans, only one of the four was actually happy about the presumptive nominee."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","host","Ira Glass","00:01:12.33",""
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","host","Ira Glass","00:01:24.06","And later on in our program, we hire two temp workers. And we put them to work doing a radio story about being temp workers. And these guys aren't office workers. These guys are part of the massive number of workers in our country right now who do temp work in factories and industrial settings."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","host","Ira Glass","00:01:43.97","That will be Act Two. That means later. Because right now, we're on Act One, Presumptiveness."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","host","Ira Glass","00:01:54.31","The Republicans we convened for our panel were these people, and gave very generously of their time, I should say, because the power went out in Navy Pier in the middle of our interviews. So these people not only-- we started our interview, then we had to take them out for drinks, and then we had to bring them back. So this is not just presumptiveness, but it's presumptiveness on the rocks. That's what this segment is."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","host","Ira Glass","00:02:17.79","Our Republicans were [? Will Tinken, ?] a bonds trader, Diane Cohen, an attorney who is, I think it'd be more accurate to describe her as a libertarian than a moderate Republican, but still shared some views with these guys. [? Brian Castle, ?] a bonds trader and money manager and 43rd Ward Republican committeeman. And Dan Parisi, who owns a pizza restaurant out in the suburbs and also works as a telephone technician for Ameritech. And as of last Tuesday, this was Junior Tuesday, before Super Tuesday, before the New York primary, before Bob Dole was fully named the presumptive nominee, Will was the only one of the four people in our panel who would look you square in the eye and actually say he had a favorite candidate."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Will Tinken","00:03:04.97","Dole. And the reason I like Dole is I just like the way he's held together in this past month. Talk about a trial by fire. His resume is impressive. He's got a unique perspective. And dare I say, I might be excited by Bob Dole."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:03:27.15","Smiles all around, I should say for people in the radio audience. Everyone else at the table just had a little grin. And there was a sort of rolling of eyes from Diane. Diane?"
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Diane Cohen","00:03:35.24","I'm just in denial. I'm waiting for Jack Kemp to announce. So I'll pass on that."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:03:40.08","So you're having trouble finding a candidate who you like."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Diane Cohen","00:03:42.96","Yes. They don't represent the ideals that brought me into the Republican Party. Ronald Reagan brought me in. And candidates I see are just not inspiring me in the same way."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:03:54.83","Brian?"
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Brian Castle","00:03:55.28","Well, I had liked Governor Pete Wilson of California early on, and so I was probably the most wrong person here at the panel, as he went out quickly. But I think Bob Dole would probably be a very good president. And I like Forbes as well."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:04:10.02","Dan, what about you? Are you having trouble finding a candidate you can love?"
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Dan Parisi","00:04:13.22","I wish that Bob Dole could get as excited about Bob Dole as Will has gotten about Bob Dole."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","host","Ira Glass","00:04:18.86","At the time, Dan and Brian were still deciding between Dole and Forbes. Diane described herself as ""off the map,"" no candidate at all. They all said they wanted the next president to be somebody who would reduce the size of government, cut regulations. Brian and Dan were especially forceful about the idea of eliminating the federal deficit. And so I proposed a theoretical candidate to our panel, somebody who would balance the federal budget in just a few years, somebody who promises to reduce the size of government and cut the capital gains tax, somebody who is for the death penalty and tougher sentences for juvenile offenders, somebody who is pro-choice. All four of them said they would at least be curious to hear more about such a candidate. Or as Diane put it--"
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Diane Cohen","00:05:01.59","Well, I'd like to hear what she has to say."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","host","Ira Glass","00:05:04.52","And then I revealed to them that this theoretical candidate, the person who I was describing to them as an acceptable moderate Republican, was, if you haven't guessed this already, President Clinton. This is where he stands on these issues."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Dan Parisi","00:05:19.57","Is that where he stands this week?"
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:05:23.37","Want to elaborate on that point? Everybody around the table, again, smiled."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Brian Castle","00:05:27.20","I'll echo what Dan says. We may agree with a lot of the positions that President Clinton carries today. And again, I say today. But we don't know where he'll be tomorrow. I don't happen to believe that President Clinton is as high of integrity person that we should have in the White House. I think that most of the Republican candidates right now do hold that integrity. And I'd rather see one of them in there."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:05:53.25","Will?"
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Will Tinken","00:05:55.49","I can't think of anybody in the field right now, the Republican field, that would not do better than President Clinton with the same views."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","host","Ira Glass","00:06:05.72","For many people, the coming presidential election is a lot like the last one in one significant way. For these people, there is only one issue. They do not like Bill Clinton. But maybe, maybe, moderate Republicans could be persuaded over to Bill Clinton's side, the way that moderate Democrats in droves, in masses, in national waves, were persuaded over to Ronald Reagan's side and George Bush's side-- once, anyway. I enlisted a little help to find out."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:06:41.51","OK, well, joining us now by telephone is Gary LaPaille, who's state chairman of the Democratic party. Gary LaPaille, are you there?"
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Gary Lapaille","00:06:48.41","I'm here."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:06:49.23","All right. So you're there. So Gary LaPaille, let me just review for a second. The four Republicans who are seated here with me have conceded that when it comes to the issues, many of President Clinton's stands and promises are fine with them. But when it comes to him the man, they are perhaps not so comfortable. Do you want to try to sell them on the idea for a second?"
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Gary Lapaille","00:07:10.00","Absolutely."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:07:10.81","OK."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Gary Lapaille","00:07:12.13","Well, this is a person that is probably the first generation, our generation, that has become president. And our generation, I think it's our time to provide the leadership of this nation. You [UNINTELLIGIBLE] to a Bob Dole, he's had his time. He's had some--"
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","host","Ira Glass","00:07:32.21","Now I should say that at this point, the panel looked around at each other, and everybody was shaking their heads. This was clearly not working with our panel. And this might seem like an odd approach for Gary LaPaille to take."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","host","Ira Glass","00:07:42.75","But according to newspaper reports, to differentiate President Clinton and Bob Dole, who share many of the same stands on many issues, White House officials are saying that they're going to play up the age and generation difference. Gary LaPaille is basically giving us a preview here of what we're going to be hearing throughout the next few months as we get into the general election. Gary LaPaille is saying what basically any leading Democratic politician will be saying about the president at this moment. And what was interesting about it was it was not persuasive with our panel."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Will Tinken","00:08:11.09","Gary, I agree that he is of course of a certain Baby Boom generation. But that's no excuse for some of the things. But I guess what Ira was saying before was we agreed with some of his positions today. But they're not positions he necessarily held six months ago, a year ago, or two years ago. How do you answer the question that he doesn't stand on the issues firmly?"
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Gary Lapaille","00:08:39.17","Well, I would have to say that when he first got into office, the first six months, we stood very firmly and got this economy back on track and put a plan in place, supported by only Democrats, that has reduced this deficit three years in a row, first time since Harry Truman, and has reduced it by over 50%. That was the whole debate in 1992, and we did it--"
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","host","Ira Glass","00:08:59.33","A brisk discussion of the economy followed this. People were astonishingly well informed, I should say. They threw around budget numbers and dates and specifics about the first Clinton budget and the second Clinton budget and consequences for Social Security."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","host","Ira Glass","00:09:13.23","And what was interesting was that none of the Republicans gave President Clinton any of the credit for the eight million jobs created over the last four years, or the rising stock market, or the record number of new small business starts. Our panelists said that the normal business cycle would've done all of that anyway. They pointed out that among these jobs were a disproportionate number of low-wage jobs."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","host","Ira Glass","00:09:32.84","And even the one area where President Clinton did stick his neck out, on his first budget, which did make dramatic cuts in the federal deficit, even here, they gave the president no credit. The cuts were not deep enough and not done with real conviction on his part, they said. Gary LaPaille, however, kept trying."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Gary Lapaille","00:09:47.96","Even the federal budget, people say, ""Oh, well, Democrats are big spenders. And we've got to cut government."" Right now, under Bill Clinton, we have the lowest federal government workforce since the days of John F. Kennedy, 270,000 less federal employees under this president from the day he took office. So something's working. He's agreed to balance his budget in seven years."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:10:08.83","Gary Lapelle, I'm afraid I don't think you're winning many converts here. People are shaking their heads no. I've tried to deliver you four potential voters, but I don't believe that you've brought them home."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Gary Lapaille","00:10:18.52","We may be right on all the issues regarding pro-choice. We may be right on some of the economic policies to go after moderate Republicans. But if you have people that are basically Republicans, they don't like being out of office. And they're going to stick with whoever their Republican nominee is."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","host","Ira Glass","00:10:37.15","Of course, the thing that bothers these Republicans the most about Bill Clinton, his waffling on the issues, is something that the presumptive Republican nominee does plenty of as well. Bob Dole has gone back and forth on the ""No new taxes"" pledge. For a while, when Pat Buchanan was scoring lots of votes with economic populism, Republican-style, Bob Dole tried to pick it up. Bob Dole even wavered on abortion rights a few weeks ago on television. But as Brian Castle on our panel pointed out, our panel still prefers Bob Dole's wavering to the president's."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Brian Castle","00:11:08.01","Well, Bob Dole certainly has made some changes in his positions over a period of time. But I guess I'd have to believe that someone who's spent so many years in Washington, who has learned the process as well as Bob Dole, does have some base beliefs. And I believe that. And I really have a hard time believing that the current president does. I think Bob Dole would be much preferred to President Clinton, even with a waffle here or there."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","host","Ira Glass","00:11:30.67","See, because I wonder, as somebody observing this process, if in the end, whether it's Dole or Clinton in the White House, if we'll end up with significantly different policies coming out of the White House. That is, under the Clinton presidency, what we've seen is the debate driven by the Republicans in Congress. And that's certain to continue even in a Dole presidency. And the president, if he's a kind of accommodator, who either Clinton or Dole is, will simply follow the political tide to where it goes and get similar results."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Brian Castle","00:11:59.47","Well, I think-- to some extent, I wanted to offer a bit of a reality check, because I think that even if we have a Republican president come in, we'll have most likely a Republican Congress at the same time. The Republican ideas will then become law in some form. They may not be the exact form that we want at one particular period of time, but the country will trend in that direction. And I believe that's good for the country."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:12:26.73","Diane, what about you?"
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Diane Cohen","00:12:27.90","I would vote for Bob Dole, even with my concerns, because I would view him as a facilitator of a Republican Congress. And that is where my hope lies, that together, we could see progress."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:12:43.83","So you don't see President Clinton as being a kind of moderate Republican who happens to simply go under the name of Democrat?"
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","1","Act One. Presumptiveness","subject","Will Tinken","00:12:50.20","I think Bill Clinton has proven that if we want moderate Republicans, he'll be a moderate Republican. If we would like a lounge singer, he'd be a lounge singer."

The Economy","host","Unspecified","00:18:19.88","Although it is the largest employer in the country, when you visit Manpower's downtown Chicago office, it doesn't feel like it's the outpost of a corporate giant. It feels like what it is, a small office, just seven people, with the idiosyncrasies of any small office. For example, where other offices might use Post-it notes or those ""While you were out"" message pads, these people use coasters, round, with gold borders, left over from some promotional something years ago. But Manpower is as good a vantage point as any for observing trends in the economy. Manpower spokesperson Stephanie Black says that in the last five years, the nature of the temp business has changed a lot as companies have looked for ways to lay off permanent staff and replace them, as needed, with temps."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","2","Act Two. The Economy","subject","Stephanie Black","00:19:04.08","The business environment has changed enough where with the competitive global market, they need to maintain a core amount of staff that is productive and that they keep for all the time. And then they fill in for special projects or peak periods or seasonal fluctuations by using temporary help."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","2","Act Two. The Economy","host","Ira Glass","00:19:26.49","While Manpower has been the beneficiary of these changes with the increased business, Stephanie Black takes pains to say that Manpower did not create the shift in the way that corporations hire or lay off workers. It simply responded."
"16","Economy","1996-03-14","2","Act Two. The Economy","host","Ira Glass","00:19:38.96","It responded well, though. Some companies use so many dozens of temps all the time that Manpower sends a full-time Manpower representative to work on-site at the company to coordinate all the temps. And while 40% of Manpower's business is office workers and 40% is industrial workers, the fastest-growing part of its business, rising from nothing to 20% just in the last few years, is a category whose very existence tells you a lot about what's going on in the economy. These are technical workers."

Now having said all that, it's important to note that one reason that Manpower has become the largest employer in the country is that it gives the people who work for it a fairly good deal, health insurance, paid vacation, and decent money. Skilled secretaries from the Chicago office make from $9 an hour to $16, and Manpower will train them to do particular jobs that it knows there's a market for."
