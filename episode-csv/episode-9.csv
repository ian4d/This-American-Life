"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:02.25"," OK, here's something that most of us would never, ever do. When Julia Sweeney's brother got cancer, and then she got cancer, she decided she wanted to talk about it with strangers from a stage in a comedy club. After the worst of all these times was over, she turned some of these stories into a one-woman show, which became a book and a movie."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:23.63","But there's something about these original recordings that she made. During the same weeks that some of the most horrible things that can happen to a person were happening to her, there's something about these recordings which is just very remarkable. Her feelings are right there on the surface."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:41.57","There's this saying that comedy equals tragedy plus time, which isn't always true but is mostly true. And in this case, there is just no time, right? Sometimes you get the feeling when you hear these recordings that she's talking about these things for the very first time with anybody. And it's from a stage."

"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:26.38","But today, what we're going to do is devote the entire program to just one thing, to this very unusual set of comic monologues. Today show's is going to proceed in two acts. Act One, Julia's Brother Gets Cancer. Act Two, Julia is diagnosed with cancer herself and gets treated. These recordings were made between October of 1994 and August of 1995 at a regular weekly comedy show called Un-Cabaret in Los Angeles, run by Beth Lapides and Greg Miller."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:55.24","Un-Cabaret started off as this kind of experiment in reaction to the predictability and lowest-common-denominator mentality of a lot of stand-up comedy. The rules of Un-Cabaret were that no comic was allowed to tell a story that he or she had ever told on stage before. So spontaneity was just built into the structure of it. And the way it would work is that every Sunday night, back in its early days, five or six people would go up, often with notes in their hands, onto the stage, and then do this thing that was somewhere between traditional stand-up and diary and a kind of reportage. It had its own very particular kind of feeling to it."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:37.51","Some quick caveats before we begin. These tapes are made from the soundboard at Un-Cabaret. And so the sound quality isn't always the greatest. Also, sometimes you're going to hear laughing and off-stage comments during the monologues. And these are from the MC and ringmaster at Un-Cabaret, Beth Lapides."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:53.38",""
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Ira Glass","00:03:13.45"," So to these tapes. This first bit is from October 23, 1994. And you know how part of being sick is dealing with everybody in your life when you're sick? A lot of the stories that Julia Sweeney tells about cancer are basically just stories about her family. Her brother moved in with her when he got cancer to be near the cancer treatment center very early in his illness. And then her parents moved in soon after that."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:03:40.70"," OK, my parents are staying with me this week. And when I say this week, I mean it's just the first of many weeks. They keep saying, ""Now, we've got to start planning the Thanksgiving dinner."" And then my mom goes, ""Why are you crying?"" And I go, ""Oh, my eyes are watering. I have this weird problem with my sinuses."" It's a special feeling to be in your mid-30s and have your parents moving in with you."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:04:12.15","I haven't revealed why my parents are here for so long until this time. And I'm trying to think very hard about the most hilarious way I can get this across. Oh, please be with me tonight. All right. So briefly, there's five kids in our family. I'm the oldest. And my brother, who's the fourth child, got lymph cancer. Hold for laughs. And it's a very tragic, terrible situation, although he's doing very well. And he is at the UCLA Cancer Center. And every day, he has radiation, and every other day, he has a spinal tap and spinal chemo. And every three weeks, he has the big chemo."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:04:57.51","So all you need to know about this is that I am with my parents, but in a very trying situation where I can't really yell at them for the small, annoying things that they do-- which I would do normally-- because of the largess of the total situation. And yet, for you, I can kvetch a little bit. All right."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:05:20.70","So anyway, suffice it to say, we're at UCLA Cancer Center every day for several hours. My mother-- who is, by the way, the same age as Dustin Hoffman. They were born on the same day. Keep this in mind. Every time we get on an elevator, she acts like it's a miracle invention that she's never encountered before. And you can imagine how many times we get on elevators in a given day. Many elevators. Every time I get on the elevator, even if it's just she and I getting on the elevator, I immediately push the ""door open"" button because it takes so [BLEEP] long for her to get in the elevator."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:06:01.67","And every time, she goes, ""Oh, oh!"" when the elevator arrives. And then I go in and push the ""door open,"" and then she goes, ""Oh!"" And then she takes a moment before she goes over the chasm between the hallway and the elevator itself, that little metal thing. ""Hurry up because the doors are going to close automatically!"" God!"
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:06:30.31","And then, she always get in, and then she looks up like, ""Oh!"" And then when we go, she goes, [INAUDIBLE GESTURE] And then when they open, she goes, ""Oh?"" It's like, I really don't think Dustin Hoffman does that. And how many millions of times have we been on elevators together? A billion."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:06:52.51","So the other thing is, my mother, she's from that generation that thinks that you would never get a second opinion about anything because doctors know everything. And also, she believes that all doctors have the same amount of knowledge in every area. So we're talking to the lymph specialist, and then we'll be walking down the hall, and there'll be a group of doctors. We know because they're men. And they're not rushing around looking very caring. That's the signal. And then she goes, ""There's some doctors. Go ask them if they know about lymph cancer."""
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:07:30.71","And I go, ""We're talking to the lymph cancer specialist in the country. I think he knows the most about lymph cancer. I don't know what these doctors do."" And she goes, ""Well, I got the home phone number of Dr. Nishamura, my old OB/GYN. And I was thinking you should call him and ask him about Mike's condition."" So I go, ""Mom, I really don't think a gynecologist who's been retired for 20 years is going to know that much about this."""
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:08:05.31","OK, but you wonder, what's Dad doing? He reads. He just buries himself in reading. And then, my dad is a diabetic. Hmm, weird. And then my brother, who is now living with me also, he gives himself shots every day for his blood counts. And so there's just syringes hanging around my house. And so a common thing for me is like, ""OK, who left their syringes on the kitchen table? Dad? We have to throw them away and break the needle."" All right."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:08:44.30","OK, so this is all an introduction to last Thursday. And then I get to the The Pope, so just wait. OK, so we're in the doctor's office. And Mike, who's doing really great and is responding really well to the treatment, but he's had so many spinal taps that they can't get into his spinal column anymore. So the doctors come in. And my dad's reading about the plague in India, because that's a good diversion. And my mom is looking at the doctors and saying, ""Now, he looks single."" And this doctor comes in, and he says, ""Michael, we can't get into your spinal column anymore. So we're thinking about putting a shunt in your head."""
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:09:23.10","And my brother goes, ""What?"" And he goes, ""A shunt."" And I go, ""A shunt, like an artificial opening to the brain."" And Mike goes, ""Well, where would this shunt be?"" And the doctor goes, ""Well, the best place we've found is to put it in the forehead."" And Mike goes, ""If you think I am going to get a faucet put into my forehead. I'm already 90 pounds and I have no hair. I am not going to walk around for a year with a faucet sticking of my forehead."" And my mom goes, ""No, I think it's more like a spigot."""
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:09:58.80","And then the doctor goes, ""But the people we know, the patients that have the shunt, they love it. Oh, they thank me for it because the pain is so much less, and when we do the operation, because it's in the brain, there's no pain."" And my brother goes, ""Oh, that's because you give them lobotomies before you put the faucet in!"" And then my dad's looking up from his article on the plague."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:10:20.49","Anyway, as you can imagine, I got a little depressed that [INAUDIBLE]. So Thursday night, I decided that I wanted-- because, as you may know, The Pope wrote a book, and it came out on Thursday. So I had to be right there to get it. And also, I wanted to get away from my home. So I get into my car, and I'm driving to Book Soup, and sadness, the new current trend in thinking, overtook me."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:10:55.07","And I had no makeup on, a little lipstick, and overalls, which are not a good choice for me. And I looked terrible, but I though I'd go to Book Soup. And then I started crying. And I started thinking, oh, why, why, why? Why can't it just end? I just don't want to go on. And if I am going to end and I really am just going to be over, why can't I smoke? Because who cares if I get lung cancer? I'm not going live that long to even have lung cancer. So I'm going to buy some cigarettes. Yes! I'm going to buy a cigarette and I'm going to smoke it. And I'm going to go to Book Soup and I'm going to buy that book from The Pope."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:11:31.04","So I'm sobbing and sobbing. So I get to Book Soup. And I kind of wipe my eyes, and I they're all red and everything. So then I go in, and then suddenly, I'm kind of seized with a moment of embarrassment-- for some reason that I don't understand, since I get embarrassed continually throughout the day with no problem, apparently-- about asking for this book that The Pope wrote. So I come in and I kind of scan the bookstore out to see if there-- I was looking for a big 10-foot cutout of The Pope with his hands out and the book. There wasn't one."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:12:00.15","So I had to go to the information desk. And I go, ""Hi, I'm looking for a book that came out today."" And the guy goes, ""Oh, jeez, it's right over there."" And I'm thinking, ""The Pope's doing some business on these books."" So I go over to this area, and it's that Resnick Nicole Simpson book. So then I go back, and I go, ""No, not the Resnick book. The Pope. The Pope's book."" So I go over and I get the Pope's Book, this book. And then I think, oh, I don't really want to just buy The Pope's book."

Like, ""You heard my call. You recognized my fart."" Anyway, I don't recognize him at all. And I go, ""Hi."" And he goes, ""Oh, you don't recognize me, do you?""

OK, here's my standard response. ""They opened it in Houston and Seattle, and nobody went or liked it. So, I don't know."""

"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:16:01.31","So I go out, I go across the street, I buy a pack of cigarettes. So now I'm really going to enjoy myself. I get into the car. My family uses my car all the time for transportation purposes. It's the normal use of a car. And they hate cigarette smoke, like anyone should. OK, so I roll down all the windows, and I'm smoking, and I'm actually starting to feel better because Marshall was just such a horrific situation that you could only feel better. You just had to go up."

And then I pull into the driveway, and I turn around, and my back seat is on fire. The cigarette has flown back into the car and had ignited my seats in the back. So I get out of the car, and I throw the cigarette out, and I'm feeling very like a girl who's just been smoking pot or something going into the house."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","2","Act One. Julia's Brother Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:17:04.69","Oh, which by the way, the prescribed pot for my brother, so my brother's also just smoking pot all around the house all the time.

I was driving down Sunset, and this old man smoking a cigarette threw it out of his car. And I noticed, because I thought, smoking is terrible.

And I don't know if he's doing well or not anymore. But he is very, very ill. So my parents are down. And like any stressful situation, their annoying qualities, their personalities, are heightened because it's a crisis situation. And it's made even more difficult for me because I can't yell at them about it because we are in a crisis. And it's like, how could I really scream at my mother for talking incessantly when her son is so very ill?"

Like, you see? You see? What do you really say to that? Well, coming up, how to make jokes about your own cancer and actually get laughs, an onstage demonstration. That's in a minute, from Chicago Public Radio and Public Radio International, when our program continues."

In this act, Julia gets diagnosed with cancer herself. And one thing that's interesting about these tapes is that once Julia Sweeney actually gets cancer, the stories get less dark. They are less tragic. There is less trouble in them. This next tape is from May of 1995. This is actually the worst sound quality of any of the tapes we're going to play for you today."

"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:30:49.70"," So about a month ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. Hold for laugh. All right. I wake up debating how and if I should bring that up. But the thing is, it's not life-threatening and I'm totally fine. And you know, in a way, I'm kind of happy for the experience. But my parents, who are staying with me way too long, and at the tail end of when they were going to be with me, then I got cervical cancer."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:31:13.96","And so, of course, they wanted to stay longer, which is the last thing I wanted was my parents to stay [BLEEP] longer with me. And then I kept thinking, ""How can I lie about my cervical cancer to my parents?"" And I'm, like, 35. Can't I just have cancer on my own?"""
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:31:31.92","So I had to get this radical hysterectomy, which now that I'm in this whole cancer thing, radical doesn't mean far out in the medical world. I just want to let you know. Anyway, so then my mom, they just make me more nervous than calm. I really have friends that would be there and make it a more calm experience. But my mom goes, ""I am going to be with you for every doctor appointment and every surgery you're going to have."" And then I found myself saying, like, ""My friends who've had hysterectomies didn't have to have their moms with them. They had their hysterectomies on their own."" And I just realized how [BLEEP] weird that is, but anyway."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:32:13.71","And I feel I wouldn't have chosen to have a hysterectomy, I guess. But I kind of feel about my reproductive organs like a bicycle that I've had in the garage, this really great bike that I've just never used. But I want to, you know? But I just never had time. And it's a really good bike. And it's in the garage, and I haven't really been maintaining it. It's all rusty now and everything. But it's there, and I bought it. And it's there. I have a garage for it. And now, I feel like fate is saying to me, ""OK, we're taking away your bicycle. You can never ride a bike again."" And so then you think, ""god, I was really going to ride that bike."""

"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two.

They'd go, ""You know, my friend had cervical cancer, and they told her that she had to have a hysterectomy. And she drank carrot juice every day and did yoga. And now she's had seven children."" And I'm like, ""Get me to the hospital!"" Really? Aaagh!"
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:34:06.48","I'll just do two more little cancer bits before I'm done. So I'm in the hospital. And they save my ovaries, which I guess is a good thing-- I'm learning all about these biological things-- because the ovaries are the things that make you lubricate when you're aroused, which, by the way, is a very important thing. And if I wanted to have a child surrogately, I could have it. So that was fine. They saved those."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:34:29.81","But then they didn't know, because I had to have radiation, if it was going to get hit. So they moved my ovaries nine inches up from their normal spot. And then, they said, ""Well, if you're really concerned about having a kid with a surrogate, we can harvest 12 eggs now, and we can freeze them for you."" And I said, ""Oh, OK."" And they go, ""But the problem is, you have to have the sperm with them in order to freeze them. They can't just be frozen eggs. They have to be fertilized eggs."" So I go, ""Oh, OK."""

So I thought, OK, so now I feel like I have this dance card with 12 eggs on it. It's like, ""If you're nice enough to me, you can have one of my eggs."""
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:35:47.92","Anyway, then I just decided that it's just too weird. So I didn't do that. So then the next thing-- this happened only two days ago-- I went into my radiation doctor. And they had to do all these x-rays and MRIs to make sure that my ovaries were out of the way of the radiation. And they cut my fallopian tubes and my uterus is out and all that stuff."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:36:05.59","So they come in and they go, ""We have some bad news. We've lost one of your ovaries.""

And they go, ""Well, one is there."" He goes, ""Sometimes, ovaries, when they're cut off from their responsibilities, go traveling."" And I go, ""That ovary! So caught up with that fallopian his whole life, responsible to that damn uterus."" He goes, ""Oh, it might show up. And it could just go floating through someday, somewhere."" I go, ""Am I going to cough, and is the ovary-- should I--"""
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Ira Glass","00:36:59.66"," That was May of 1995. This next moment is a little further into her treatment-- a month later. And just a quick warning, some of the language here may not be suitable for younger listeners."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:37:11.78"," All right. Oh, I had my vagina tattooed. It's true. Some people say, you know, ""I love Tom."" Mine says ""aim the beams here."" I have a little cancer. So I had to have a hysterectomy, and now I'm having radiation. Everything seems to be fine, and I'm on the gazillionth percentile of making it. But it doesn't mean that I don't have to have eight weeks of radiation. So right now, I'm in the fourth week."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:37:50.18","So when you get radiation, you have to get a tattoo on the area that you're getting radiated.

"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:39:02.10","And then, all of a sudden, he's going like this, and then he goes, ""I think the best one is when Pat went to the barber."" [BLEEP], you know? I'm like, ""Yeah, that was a good one too. I think the kicker is now that Pat has cervical cancer, we know what--"" This is so personal. I can't even believe I'm telling you guys this, but I guess that's the whole point of Un-Cabaret, even though it'll make you uncomfortable."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:39:41.50","So the first half is external radiation, where they beam you from the outside. And then the second half that I start next week is internal radiation. Think about it. OK, so I call it the ""dildo of radiation."" And in fact, I insist on referring to it as the ""dildo of radiation,"" and the doctors get really upset. Because I go, ""When do we start the dildo of radiation?"" So I had to go in and get measured, and they had to make this cylinder that fit exactly me and everything."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:40:11.91","So then I go, ""So this dildo of radiation, will it be vibrating?"" And then the doctor goes, ""Actually, it will be vibrating."" And I said, ""It will?"" It's sick, because the light in this doctor's eyes when he talks about how this is the cutting edge of technology, it scares me because I really feel like that's the point of it is that they get to do this to me. When they go like, ""Yes, you really need that, because this is the cutting edge of technology and hardly anyone's gotten this and we're really working on it!"" Do I really need it?"
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:40:52.49","Anyway, so I have to go. So then last week, they're trying to prepare me for it and everything. And they go, ""Well, you know, it lasts three hours."" Oh my god, yes! So I go, ""Three hours?"" And they said yes. And I said, oh. And also, I won't get into details, but the other orifices in that area will also be filled with other instruments for three hours."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:41:17.38","And when they said, ""You have an option. We can send you to the cancer therapist at Cedars-Sinai to learn visualization techniques, or we can give you an IV of Valium. Actually, I kind of feel bad because they really were trying to push the visualization. So I just went, ""I am very good at visualizing. I'm an actress and visualization is my hobby and my expertise."" I think when it comes to medical procedures, an IV of Valium is going to work a lot better than thinking about an ocean."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:42:01.60","Oh yeah, this is another sick thing that I do. It's not funny, only sick. I have this thing where the clothes in my closet don't know that I have cancer. And if I haven't worn them since before when I found out I had cancer, I have to tell them when I put my clothes on. So I'll put on a dress, and I'll think, ""Oh, this dress doesn't even know."" And so then I'll put on the dress and I'll think, ""Oh, dress. Don't you realize what's happened to me?"" And the dress goes, ""That's terrible, but you'll be OK."""
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Ira Glass","00:42:35.28"," OK, well, that was June 4, 1995. Not long after that, Julia Sweeney returned to Un-Cabaret. She was getting her treatment, still. And she was getting her treatment at one hospital, and her brother was getting treated at another hospital. And her case, apparently, was this very rare type of cervical cancer. And it turned out that the one doctor in this world who was studying this particular type of cancer happened to be located at his hospital, not at hers. And so at some point, slides of her cells were shipped over to his hospital. And then they were going to do some procedure on her, so she had to get the slides back so they could do this procedure. And she offered to go and fetch the slides herself."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:43:21.60"," I didn't know where I was going. All I knew is his name was Dr. Fu. So I go over, and it's not really part of the hospital where the research is done. It's in this other building, and it's all restricted areas. And I just kept going through doors and doors where people were wearing more and more green things. And more people had masks and stuff. And I was knocking on doors. And everyone was so confused about what I wanted. And I'd have to say, ""Hi, I'm looking for the Julia Sweeney cancer slides."" And they'd all go, ""Oh, for who?"" And I'd say, ""For Julia Sweeney-- me."" And they'd go, oh."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:43:54.15","And then finally, I found this Dr. Fu's door, and I knocked on it.

And I said, ""Yes, I hear that you have the Julia Sweeney cancer slides."" And he says, ""Yes."" And I go, ""Yes, I've come here to pick them up."""

He goes, ""I have been getting grants to study this special kind of cancer for 20 years. And only 50 women in the world have been diagnosed with this special kind of cancer.

And he said, ""Well, how does it feel to have this cancer?"" And I said, ""Well, you know, I actually have no symptoms. It's kind of hilarious that I just have no symptoms. It seems like all of the problems have been coming from the cure of this, but not from the actual cancer."""
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:45:32.83","And he goes, ""Oh, there's only 50 women in the world, and none of them have died from it."" And I go, ""Oh, you can always hope."" And I go, ""Oh, great."" And he wanted to know if I'd been on birth control pills, because that's what he thinks it was related to, which I had. And he's asking me, ""What are your habits?"" And I go, ""Well, I like to run and ski. Maybe people who run and ski and take birth control pills get this cancer."""
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:46:05.54","And then he goes, ""Well, can I take you out for some coffee or something?"" And I said yeah.

"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:46:14.58","OK, well, then I found out a few weeks later, after the slides went back, that I didn't have that cancer. I had a different kind of really rare cervical cancer, but not that specific kind. And I don't think they ever really told that guy, because this week, he called me up. And he said, ""Hey, how are you doing?"" and everything. And I said, ""Oh, I'm fine. I did all of the surgeries and the radiation. I'm feeling great."" And he said, ""That's so great."""
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:46:40.94","And then I realized that I was too embarrassed to tell him I didn't have his cancer. I go, ""Yeah."" And he goes, ""Well, I'm really glad. No one who's had that cancer has died. They've had to go through hell, but they haven't died."" And then I just had to play into it. And then I realized that I'm so co-dependent that I didn't want him to think that I didn't have the cancer he was studying. I had to pretend. So sick."
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Ira Glass","00:47:05.61"," All these stories that we've been hearing began in 1994. And finally, in July of 1995, Julia Sweeney took the stage at Un-Cabaret to announce--"

I only say this because-- I don't know if anyone was here for other sets where I talked about it-- but I got a little cancer. And I did surgery, and I did radiation. And my last radiation was on Wednesday. And so now I can't say I have cancer anymore, which I have to say, I will totally cop to the fact that I'm kind of missing that, because I just loved not necessarily doing, but having that moment where I could say, ""I don't know if you've heard, but I have cancer."""
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:47:53.72","But now I can say, ""I am in remission."" I guess that's the term, although no doctor has even said that to me. They just said, ""All right, you did enough. See you later."" I said, ""Don't you mean to tell me I'm in remission?"""
"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:48:10.52","So on Wednesday, I had to have my last radiation. And it's this kind of horrible ordeal that lasts three hours and is very personally invasive into certain orifices of your body. Imagine.

"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:48:34.00","And they gave me Percocet and codeine and everything.

"9","Julia Sweeney","1996-01-10","3","Act Two. Julia Gets Cancer","host","Julia Sweeney","00:49:56.57"," So anyway, this is not even funny. OK, I'll just tell it really quick.
