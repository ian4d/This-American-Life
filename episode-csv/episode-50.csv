"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:12.68","The day Sandra should have been dead started like a normal day. She was cutting school with the girls in her gang."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","1","Prologue","subject","Sandra","00:00:17.67","We were standing there, and a group of girls passed us, and they looked at us, and we looked at them. And of course, automatically our mouths flew open without thinking. What are you looking at? Oh, you got something? What do you be about? And started asking them what their affiliation is, and other stuff. And we started talking [BLEEP] to them and other stuff. And they pulled out a gun, and they said OK, you want to talk [BLEEP] now? Let's talk [BLEEP]. And I panicked. I mean, nobody had ever pulled a gun on me. I was like, holy [BLEEP], and I just started kind of running around, and I was like, oh my god, they're going to kill us. They're actually going to kill us. It had finally sunk in that somebody was going to kill us, that that would be it, the end of my life. At like 14, somebody was going to kill me."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","1","Prologue","subject","Sandra","00:01:09.40","And it kind of flashed in my mind that here comes my mother finding me on the street corner with a bullet through my head and blood gushing everywhere, and oh my god. So everybody just kind of spread out, and I ran, and I lost my shoes, and my jacket, my purse. I lost everything. I was just like throwing things off me to make me lighter so I could run faster. And finally I jumped into a dumpster, and I stood there. And I must have stood there a good hour, hour and a half. And I just stood there and prayed and shaked, and tried to not make noise. And I heard them run past me, and run past me, and screaming ""bitch"" and looking for people. And I was there, and I was praying to God that they didn't open the dumpster and find me, because if they would have, I think I would have been dead."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:05.28","In movies and books, when somebody nearly dies it changes them. You know? They mend their ways. They treat people better. But in real life, it can go either way. Sandra waited and finally walked home alone, smelling like garbage, unrepentant."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","1","Prologue","subject","Sandra","00:02:25.23","And my mother asked me, where's your shoes and your purse and your jacket and everything? And I told her that these girls were going to beat us up. I lied and I said that they started talking to us. They were gang-bangers. I told her like that, that they were gang-bangers, and they were looking for trouble. Knowing full well--"
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:02:42.18","Yeah, knowing full well."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","1","Prologue","subject","Sandra","00:02:44.06","Knowing full well that I was the one that started it, and that I was gang-banging."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:02:53.35","But even after that you didn't quit the gang."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","1","Prologue","subject","Sandra","00:02:56.26","No. Why? A lot of different answers why. We didn't get hurt. We got to go back and tell our story. And none of us said that we hid. You know, none of us said we hid."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:03:12.71","What did you say?"
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","1","Prologue","subject","Sandra","00:03:13.50","We said that we outran them."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:03:16.45","As if that's more heroic."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","1","Prologue","subject","Sandra","00:03:19.05","It's better than saying I hid in the garbage can. That's cowardly."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:03:24.39","But outrunning them is still just as fleeing."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","1","Prologue","subject","Sandra","00:03:25.70","But they had a gun. It's fleeing, but it's honorable fleeing."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:03:35.59",""
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","host","Ira Glass","00:04:18.90","Act One. So what if you knew? What if you really knew the date and time of your own death? Well, Kevin Kelly spent most of his twenties wandering around Asia. He was a freelance photographer. And he found himself photographing a lot of religious ceremonies. He found himself drawn to religious ceremonies. He was confused about what he believed."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:04:40.80","I would get twisted and caught up, and these things were sort of in the background consuming me. Actually I found that I could think about little else for many, many months, that behind all that I was doing there was always this unresolved question of was God real? If he was real, then how could we ignore him? And if we were trying to not ignore him, what do we do? And if he was real, then what about these other things that people said about God?"
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","host","Ira Glass","00:05:11.59","But all that changed. When he was 27, he came into Jerusalem. It was the weekend of both Easter and Passover, and the city was flooded with tourists."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:05:21.23"," So I entered Jerusalem on Easter with the simple expectation that I was going to photograph yet another religious ceremony, another religious festival. And then for various reasons I got locked out of my hostel room. They had a curfew, and I didn't make it back in time. And I was in quite a fix because I was a stranger in this very strange town. When it happened, I didn't have enough money to stay elsewhere, nor did I even have knowledge of where to go."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:05:58.72","So I wandered the old town of Jerusalem at night, which had been shuttered up and was like a time machine. It was if I had been transported back into the 15th century, because all the souvenir vendors were gone, and what was left were the labyrinthine paths of cobbled passageways. And I wandered around for a number of hours, and it was getting colder. Eventually I found myself at the one place that was still open, which was some of the churches. And particularly I finally settled into the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which is called and viewed as the church built over the mound where Jesus Christ was crucified."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:06:50.89","And I was getting very tired, and there weren't many people around. And so eventually I laid myself out on about the only flat area that was left, which was this marble slab underneath some pendants that had incense on them. And this was presumably the slab that commemorated the exact position of the crosses. So I slept there. I slept on the crucifixion spot that night because it was the only place. There was no place in the inn."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:07:34.28","I slept there until early morning, when the activities started to increase, and people started coming in. And I went out and followed the crowd where it was going when they were going out to the tombs area in Jerusalem. And I went out, and there were some folding chairs set up in front of this tomb area. And as the sun was coming up on that Easter morning, I was staring at empty tombs."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:08:09.29","And for a reason that I cannot comprehend, as I sat on that chair contemplating this view of the early sun morning coming into the empty tombs, all that I had been wrestling with for the past many, many years in thinking about religion sort of became resolved in my mind. And at that very moment, I believed that Jesus Christ has indeed risen from those tombs."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:08:53.64","In an instant the tension of trying to figure things out was resolved, because now suddenly everything was figured out. It was as if you had been working on a problem for a long time, and suddenly the answer was there, and it was very clear that was the answer. And although there were many things that were still not clear to you, you were very certain that you were on the right path."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:09:24.17","Having that realization that I believe that Jesus Christ had actually risen from those tombs did not settle 1,001 other things about what one was supposed to do with that, what I was supposed to do with that. Did that mean I was supposed to be a monk? Did that mean I was supposed to be an evangelist? Did that mean that I had to immediately renounce all that I had and get into sackcloth and ashes and march out into the desert? All of that was left unopened, and that is in fact what occupied my mind as I went back to my hostel to lay down and think about, because I had no clue what it really meant to me ultimately."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:10:04.94","And that's what I was pondering when I sort of was laying there napping. And I wouldn't say it's a voice, but there was an idea that came into my mind that just would not go away. And that was that I should live as if I would die in six months, that I should really truly live. And that I could not tell for certain whether I would really die, but that either way I should live as if I was going to die. And so that was the assignment."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:10:42.69","I'm a pretty rational person. I'm pretty logical. And after thinking the thought that I should live as if I was going to die in six months, the first thought that comes to my head was, well that's pretty silly. You have no evidence whatsoever. I could live like I'm going to die in six months and not die at all. It would just be kind of an interesting exercise. But at the same time, it was equally probable that I might die in six months. It happened all the time. There was no guarantee that I wouldn't die. And so fairly quickly I decided that I could not settle that issue of whether I would really die or not, or just think that I was going to die in six months. And that in either case, the important thing was to live as if I really believed that I was going to die in six months. Which is what I set out to do."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:11:46.17","The next couple days had a kind of joyous experience of saying, OK, what do I do for six months if I have only six months to live? And the answers to that surprised me as much as the assignment. Because after thinking that through and contemplating it, the conclusion that I came to was that what I wanted to do for six months was to go home and be ordinary, to go back to my parents, to help them take out the trash and trim the hedges and move furniture around, and to be with them."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:12:24.81","And I was really shocked by that, because I thought that with six months to live I would climb Mount Everest, or I would go scuba diving to the depths of the ocean, or get in a speedboat and see how fast I could go. But instead I wanted to go back home and be with my family for that time."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:12:54.71","I, of course, did not tell anybody my crazy idea. This is, in fact, the first time I'm really talking about it publicly, because it was a very scary and sort of alarming idea, and I never told anybody why I was coming home."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:13:19.69","I got back to where my parents live in New Jersey, and things were unbelievably ordinary. And yet I found myself relishing the ordinariness and finding it in some ways as exotic as anything that I had traveled to see. And so I was involved in-- I helped around the house. I dug up shrubs. I worked on a deck. I moved furniture, washed dishes, and I was intending to kind of spend my last remaining six months at home getting to know my parents better, and myself hopefully."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:14:04.72","But about three months into that, my travel urges I guess got the better of me. And what I was most concerned about is I wanted to see my brothers and sisters. I had four brothers and sisters, and they were scattered all across the country. And so I felt very strongly that I wanted to see them before I died. And I got the idea that the way to see them was to ride my bicycle across the country and visit them on bicycle."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:14:33.92","But before I did that, I made up a will to dispose of the little things that I had. And I had some money left over, and one of the things that I did with that money was I went to the bank and got some cashier's checks for like $500 and $1,000. And I mailed the money to various people anonymously as gifts. And I think giving away those thousands of dollars was the first true act of charity I had ever done, because there was absolutely no way for any kind of gratitude or elevated feelings to come back to me, because people had no idea who had sent them that money."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:15:28.62","It was really remarkable to see the consequences of getting an anonymous gift like that, because when you get a check for $1,000 in the mail, you immediately become suspicious of all your friends of having given it to you. And so there's this sort of like the suspicion of charity, suspicion of goodness, that starts to infect the people that are around you. And you look at someone, you think, hmm, I wonder if he gave me that $1,000?"
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:16:06.77","I had enough money left over to basically pay for food and whatnot on my bicycle journey across America. And the path that I had to visit all my brothers and sisters was not a direct route of going from San Francisco to New York. I actually had to go up to Idaho and back down to Texas, and then back up through Indiana. So it was a 5,000 mile trip."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:16:29.75","The day, which coincidentally was exactly six months from when I had this assignment, was October 31, was Halloween. And so the plan would be that I would ride back home so that I would come back to die on the day after Halloween."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:17:12.72","I think there are a lot of people who have trouble staying in the present. There are some people who like to slip into the past as a means to perhaps fantasize or escape, and they find that the past is the place that they retreat to. And I often retreat to the future. I was not a person who planned or had a career staged out, or who had a particular woman he wanted to marry someday, or some vision of a house. The future that I found so hard to give up was a much more insidious type. It was that of-- I like to buy this record because in the future I want to hear the song again and again. Or I will read this book, and there's some cool ideas in it because someday I may write an article about this, and it's kind of good to know that."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:18:10.18","There was a sense in which my entire life was shifted to the future, and the thought of sort of doing something now for the enjoyment or the pleasures or the principle of the function of just right now, without any sense at all that it would ever be used again or that it could ever be brought forward, was extremely difficult and disconcerting. And I fought it day by day, and tooth by tooth."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:18:45.06","One of the ways I dealt with this was that I was actually able by the last weeks to not think about my life beyond Halloween. There was a way in which I had just-- each time a thought came up about something that was beyond this horizon, I just said, nope, can't think about, it doesn't work. We have to dwell in the present. And at the same time I was doing that-- and I was able to do that-- I also decided that it was entirely unnatural and inhumane way to live, and that having a future is part of what being human is about, and that when you take away the future for humans, you take away a lot of their humanness. And that it's not actually a very good thing to live entirely in the present, that one needs to have a past, and one needs to have a future to be fully human."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","host","Ira Glass","00:19:51.03","So he bicycled across the country, and as he did he found himself increasingly obsessed with death, with dying. He was making drawings and writing haikus along the way, and as he went across the country, they became more and more dark, more and more preoccupied with death. And as he traveled across the country, the other thing is that he always had to find a place to stay every night. And at first he just tried what he had done in Jerusalem. That is, he would just find a church, and he would camp out on the church lawn. But people got upset at that."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","host","Ira Glass","00:20:25.58","And so what he decided to do instead is that at each town that he would come into, he would find some quiet residential street. And he'd go up to a house, and he'd say hi, this is who I am. I'm bicycling across the country. I've just eaten dinner, he would say so they wouldn't feel obligated to feed him. Can I camp out in back? And invariably they would say yes, and invariably they would also at some point invite him in for coffee."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:20:51.34"," So I would spend my evenings with entirely ordinary people, and my job at that point was to tell them my story. It was to tell them how great a time I was having, because if I wasn't having a great time they were really disappointed, because I was riding for them. I was vicariously doing what they had always wanted their lives to do, and so the more I enjoyed my time, and the more in the present I was living, the more they enjoyed it, and the more it uplifted them. And so that was basically my job."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:21:41.62","It was a journey that began at the tomb of Jesus, and as I set off to my own presumed death, I did indeed think about Jesus Christ. We have the history in the Gospels of Jesus' torment in his soul as he approached what he knew of his anointed time to die. So it was again that very harsh information of knowing when you're going to die. And Jesus' soul was in great turmoil and pain because of knowing that. And I think I did experience some of that, not because I had the same weight. That was just my own life. But Jesus prayed that this burden be lifted, and there were days when I did pray that, that if I didn't have to die, I really would rather not."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:23:05.58","By late fall I was pedaling through the Appalachians, and it was getting colder and colder, and my hands were freezing on the bicycles, and there was ice on my tents in the morning when I got up. And as each day went on, I was coming closer and closer to terrain that I was familiar with and that felt like home. And I was riding into New Jersey, and I was elated. I was elated that I had accomplished this long journey, and I was elated that I was home to see my parents."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:23:38.52","And I came into their house on Halloween day, and I was so filled with ideas and things and emotions that I didn't really say very much. And again, I couldn't say very much. I think we had a wonderful dinner. They were, of course, glad to see me, because they hadn't seen me in a long time. They knew I was coming back, and we had a wonderful dinner. We had baskets of candy which I gave out to the kids."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:24:07.95","And we had a discussion that night which was about nothing in particular. It was not about the future. It was just about I think talking about our family, and my brothers and sisters, and I was telling them all that I had learned about them. And so it was a very together and, again, not a very dramatic evening, but just a pleasant one, the kind of one that you might have a memory about as you were dying. It was not a special evening, but just an ordinary evening."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:24:41.20","And I went to bed that night, which was a very difficult thing to do, because I was fully prepared at that point never to wake up again. I had been praying. I had gotten everything arranged. And at that point I'd fully gone through in my own mind, my own soul, all the things that I might have regretted, and I had righted as many of those as I thought I could through letters. And I was prepared as much as anybody could be prepared to die."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:25:14.19","So I went to bed while the kids were still ringing the doorbells. And I went to sleep, because I was very tired after that long trip. And I didn't know what was going to happen the next day. I thought that I had done all that I could."
"50","Shoulda Been Dead","1997-01-17","2","Act One. Die In Six Months","subject","Kevin Kelly","00:25:32.82","And the next morning I woke up. And the next morning I woke up, and it was if-- the next morning I woke up, and it was if I had my entire life again. The next morning I woke up, and I had my entire life again. I had my future again. There was nothing special about the day. It was another ordinary day. I was reborn into ordinariness, but what more could one ask for?"

Luke thinks briefly about how the fingernails keep on growing even after a person dies, but he pushes that thought away with his fingers to his forehead, wonders why he's thinking about that.

And I said-- I don't remember exactly what I said in it, but I was writing letters to him when he was in the ICU unit, because I didn't want to go in there. I didn't want to go in there.

I situate myself upright in bed so as to feed myself, and lift the cover off the entree. They've served me my own pancreas. What's more is they try to pass it off as Italian beef. I tell the nurse there's been a mistake. I think I may have somebody else's tray. ""No,"" she says, ""no mistake."""

Maybe I'm not so lucky after all. Maybe they're wrong about me. Maybe I won't have to return to that world of tending bar, and waiting tables, and customers with their selfish tastes and relentless hungers for penny ante attention. No more train and bus connections."

And friends will flock in from the trees or wherever it is they've been hiding, and tell me over and over again how much they love me. They'll tell me not so much in words but in the way they massage my feet, get me ice cream, and bring me gifts. ""Not another book on the mind-body connection. Oh, put it with the stack of others there in the corner. Did you find out if Toshiro had any more of those little bed jackets for me?"""

He tells me at this point I should do anything to lift my spirits."

I let one of the nurses wear my bed cap, the one with mink along the brim. A few of us are busted for smoking in the bathroom. Drunk on Fools Wit long after the others have returned to their rooms, I prank phone call various former employers, leaving messages of hell-born prophecy on their voice mail. I make a list of hardships and collection agencies I will escape if I were to die. How soon is now?"

Because the fund only amounts to a thimble full of pollen, the early death is useful. I wake with the image of me standing before a subcommittee selling a special gas made from identical molecular bee genetics that can be sprayed on postal employees. I hold a sign that reads, works until drops dead."

He would hear bad news about people who he knew, fellow patients who he heard had died, and he says that he just didn't feel much. It was as if he had arrived at a state where all the events of the world seemed of equal weight, of equal importance. Well, we thought we would give Matthew the last word in today's program."

You watched the cook chopping up onions, and I recognized the look on your face. Events had equalized for you. You had been pulled three quarters out of the world, and I wanted to say what's happening to you is not fair. It's not time yet, and statements of that kind."
