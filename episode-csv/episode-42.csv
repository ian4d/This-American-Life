"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:00:28.96","Well, it was Danielle's cousin, Lynn, who said it best. She said that Danielle and I had put ourselves into the kind of situation that 1,000 comedies had been built on, situation comedies, screwball comedies, every kind of TV, theatre, movie, drama thing. We had done that. We had done that to ourselves."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:00:50.66","And how did we not know? Here we were, Danielle and I. We used to be involved. And it was our first time together as just friends."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:01:11.83","Just friends. Just friends. You know you are in trouble when the word ""just"" appears in front of the word ""friend."" It's almost hard to think of a context where those two words are used together, a sentence constructed-- unless you're using the word ""just"" in some radically different way, like, ""I think the verdict was just. Friends may disagree."" If they have nothing to do with each other, maybe it's OK. But-- but, but, but."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:01:43.19","Because automatically, it implies a negotiation's happening, just friends. Friends is like a state of being. Friends is like there's a road. There are houses. People are friends. So when you put ""just"" in front of it, it suggests the imbalance. And that's where you get the screwball comedy aspect."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:02:10.00","All right, I'm going to try to keep the mundane personal information to a minimum here so we can focus on the bigger, universal truths this story may offer. Briefly, some facts, though. OK, Danielle and I had been broken up for half a year. And she lived in New York City. I lived in Chicago. And we talked on the phone several times a week."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:02:30.41","In other words, that kind of weird, post-relationship situation where there's no more sex, but you depend on each other for all your emotional needs. So all the work of the relationship, but none of the sheer physical pleasure. That was our thing."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:02:48.45","Anyway, so two days before I came to New York City to visit friends there-- real friends, not just friends, just normal friends-- and Danielle, she informs me that there's a guy that she had started dating. 'I like him,"" she said. ""I really like him."" And then two days later, I found myself in New York City."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:03:21.14","And your wish in this kind of situation is you want a sense of, OK, we're going to be friends. It's going to be OK. We're going to see how this new thing between us feels. And we're trying to hang out and be buddies. And that's how we ended up in Saks Fifth Avenue, where the first moment of our screwball comedy weekend occurred."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:03:47.59","So we're walking through that big, cold-floored Fifth Avenue store, the mannequins everywhere and Anne Klein and Anne Klein Two and Anne Klein Contemporaries-- there are actually three different Anne Klein departments at Saks Fifth Avenue-- and all the other designers. And it wasn't too crowded, and it wasn't too empty. And she was walking ahead of me, just a step or two ahead of me, never quite meeting my eye."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:04:18.00","And I realized that, oh, that's the way this has been for an hour or two, isn't it? When we were walking up the street, it was like that. She wasn't quite meeting my eye. She wasn't quite talking to me. It was like she was holding a certain emotional distance."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:04:35.88","And that's the thing that gets to you. It's not the big picture. No, we're not together. No, we have no future together. It's the little picture. No, you won't meet my eyes anymore."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:04:51.75","And in each of our histories of love, who has not played both parts in this drama? Both parts, who hasn't been both people in this picture at one time or another? The person walking a little briskly ahead, not meeting the eye of the other person, and the person walking behind, a little over-eager, a little extra edge of anxiousness, wanting to make the connection, a little bit like an eager puppy. The other person ahead, a little bit put off by the yapping of this puppy. No matter how subtle and dignified and interesting that yapping happens to be, just kind of not wanting to deal with this, not wanting to face this situation, walking ahead about three paces. Who among us has not been on both sides of that?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:06:03.10","So she's looking for clothes. And she has this new guy she's seeing. And she's carrying the clothes. And we're looking for a dressing room. And we find a dressing room. And we stand outside the dressing room."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:06:19.34","And it's an automatic setup situation. Do I come into this dressing room and watch you try on-- she's like, ""I want you to see these clothes."" OK, do I come into the dressing room? There's something inherently odd and awkward about not coming in, because what is in there that I have not seen before? But there's something inherently awkward about coming in as well because things have changed."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:06:48.15","Either way, there's a problem. So we stood there in the door of this dressing room and composed the orbits that we're riding against each other, right? We looked at the two little orbits and decided, OK, I'll go in."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:07:12.53","And she takes off her clothes and tries on these clothes. And the clothes she has gotten are the following. There's a little lacy, clingy, sort of stretched top of black, kind of like a black lace thing that you would wear maybe a jacket over to cover your nipples. And so she's got that on."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:07:42.22","And she's got this little miniskirt. And while we've been walking around Saks, she's been saying, ""I've got to find a miniskirt. I really need a black miniskirt."" She just switched jobs. And so she's trying on this miniskirt. And she's looking very cute. She's looking adorable."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:08:01.48","And suddenly, she's trying on the miniskirt, so I say, ""Well, honey, you have a miniskirt. You have that black pleated miniskirt. I've seen you in that miniskirt a million times."" She says, ""No, no, no, no. No, no. That miniskirt comes down to here."" And she indicates a spot maybe an inch above her knee. ""I need a miniskirt that's a lot shorter. I need it to come to here."" And she indicates a spot maybe, I don't know, six inches, eight inches, above her knee. Six inches. A lot higher. And there's a pause. And she looks at me and says, ""Well, I wouldn't wear this to work."""
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:08:47.00","So I start to think to myself, ""What am I doing here? Who are these clothes for?"" And I picture the guy who she's going out with. And I picture pretty much him looking at the clothes, her trying to look cute in the clothes, her looking very cute in the clothes. I pretty much picture everything you can picture."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:09:20.88","And I'm sitting down on the chair. There's a little chair in the dressing room. And so there's Danielle, looking adorable in her little clothes, and kind of absorbed in looking at it this way and that. And I'm going to try to describe the gesture that occurs next. Imagine me, a tallish sort of guy, slumped in this chair, leaning back in this chair in this dressing room. And I hope I can convey this over the radio, the motion she does next."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:09:55.29","I had been feeling like she kind of wasn't seeing me. When we were walking around the store, I felt a little bit ignored, like not seen. And I'm sitting in the dressing room thinking, ""You know, I should really leave this dressing room. I don't really need to see this right now."""
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:10:08.70","And just as I'm thinking this thought, she takes off the miniskirt, and she just kind of tosses it onto the chair, as if it were an empty chair. But in fact, I'm sitting on it. So she just tosses the skirt onto me."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:10:33.15","And suddenly, she looks up. And in horror, actually, I have to say, to her credit, in actual horror, and sees this skirt kind of sitting on my chest, because I'm slumped backwards. And so there's this semi-horizontal surface. And this skirt is now sitting on my chest, looking ridiculous. And suddenly, she realizes exactly what she's done. And she says to me, ""Oh, no. You're going to talk about this on your radio show, aren't you?"""
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:11:13.80",""
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:11:26.70","Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme. Today's theme is Get Over It. We bring you three stories of people who have a hard time letting go of the past. Act One of our program, the act we're in, right now, is nonfiction. Act Two is fiction. Act Three is a little documentary."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:11:43.79","And I bring up what happened between me and Danielle because I think that she and I stumbled upon a few things that happen universally in the ""get over it"" situation. For one thing, one of the most delicate aspects of this situation is how much information do you want about your ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend, or your ex-whatever's new whatever?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:12:10.71","My friend Julie told me a story in mourning that went as follows. She had hungrily devoured every piece of information she could get about one of her ex-boyfriends' new girlfriends. And at one point, he told her that the girl had a dog. And somehow, that detail made Julie crazy."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:12:31.16","It made her feel like, ""Oh my god, this is a person with her life worked out completely. This is a person whose life is so much better than mine. This person has a dog, which means that they have a life that can surround a dog. And the fact that they have a dog means that they're a person capable of love. And it means that they're a person in a stable situation, with a home where they can have a dog."" And suddenly, everything came into question about him and her and the girl. And I wanted to avoid that. But I wanted information. And I don't know exactly why, but there was a powerful herd of stampeding horses within me, wanting information. And I found myself asking questions."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:13:17.30","And I know, ""Listen very carefully to these questions. Listen very carefully, Ira. Because whatever it is that you're asking will indicate something about yourself. And the order you ask them will indicate something. You can learn something here."" And I listened. And I said to myself, OK."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:13:34.60","""How old is he?"" ""He's 28."" And OK, that one made sense. The age difference between Danielle and I had been kind of a big issue. And so I was trying to gauge where this new guy fit into the geography of that old, familiar landscape."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:13:50.40","See, that's part of what this is about. You have this map of an emotional city that you've built with another person. And you want to figure out, well, where are they on the map now?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:14:01.76","So my second question was going to be, ""So what's he do? What's he do for a living?"" But you know how every now and then, you'll read an article, or somebody at a party will say, ""Isn't it shallow?"" They'll say, ""Isn't it shallow that when people want to know about other people, the first question they ask is, 'What do they do for a living?' Isn't that so shallow? Doesn't that indicate what a shallow group of people we are?"""
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:14:25.69","And I thought, I don't want to fall into that trap. I don't want to fall into that trap of just equating people with their jobs. You don't want to think we are our jobs. That's just a shallow sort of thing."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:14:38.98","So I sidestepped that question and came up with another question. The question I found myself asking-- I don't know where this came from-- was, ""Is he a Jew?"" I've been to services, what, once in the last 15 years? ""Is he a Jew?"""
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:15:10.36","I think what I meant by it was is he a member of my tribe? Is he like me? Is he like me, honey? Honey, you're seeing somebody else? Is he like me? He must be like me if you're seeing him, right? The only person you could be interested in is me, so he must be like me."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:15:32.87","He was not a Jew."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:15:46.03","Now, I would like to tell you, beloved radio listener, that this phase of jealousy and competitiveness passed quickly on my part, that I moved with grace and ease into the world of just friends. I would like to say that. But one of the rules of getting over it, in fact, maybe the main rule of getting over it, is that you cannot choose the time and place. You cannot will it to happen. You cannot think, ""OK, now. I have the right attitude right now. I'm over it. I'm ready. I'm over it, and it's now."""
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","2","Act Two. Wishing For Amnesia","host","Ira Glass","00:16:26.93","It's like when Jesus returns. I say this to you as a Jew. It's like when Jesus returns. None will know the exact day or hour. It can come like a thief in the night, the getting over it. Well, coming up in just a little bit, another story of somebody trying to get over it, trying to will himself to get over it, with exactly as much success as you would expect anybody to have who tries. Stay with us."

"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:47:15.87","All right. Well, let me ask you this. Say I have the ability to make you have amnesia. If I flip the switch, you won't remember your name. You won't remember who you are. What do you think?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Jeff Harris","00:47:32.56","What do I think?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:47:34.23","Yeah, would you do it or not?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Jeff Harris","00:47:35.60","Would you?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:47:41.31","I would want to do it because then I think that I would lose my ego. I would have a clean slate."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Jeff Harris","00:47:51.93","If all of a sudden, you sat here and you couldn't remember why you were holding this microphone or who I am or why you're talking to me, to say that was disorienting would be too mild."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:48:06.47","I think I would be smart enough to realize this is a gift. There's two choices. Either you realize that it's a gift, or you completely freak out. One or the other."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Jeff Harris","00:48:16.28","But you're talking as if you wake up in the morning. You don't know where you are, who you are, where in the hell you're going, and you're happy with it? Give me a goddamn break."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:48:26.98","That still seems attractive to me. It still seems like it might be a good thing. To be put in a situation where I have to admit that I'm completely lost seems like--"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Jeff Harris","00:48:36.91","Oh, I think you already are, Scott."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Jeff Harris","00:48:39.12","[LAUGHTER]"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","host","Scott Carrier","00:48:50.59","After five days, having found no one who had or had had amnesia, I decided to visit a hypnotherapist, Diane Bradshaw, and ask her if she could give me amnesia. She said she probably could do it, as long as I was willing to be put under hypnosis. She said some people just weren't willing."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:49:09.10","And if you're open to the possibility that, say, amnesia would be OK for five minutes or one minute, it might happen."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:49:20.40","Well, I'm open to even a day. Would that be a bad idea?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:49:28.42","What do you really want here? Do you want to get that extreme?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:49:30.65","Let's say a few hours anyway. What do you think? Because he's going to have to hang out with me."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:49:34.81","You know what I think?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Jeff Harris","00:49:35.64","I think an hour."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:49:36.78","I think if you had a half hour of amnesia, you would get it pretty quick."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:49:40.98","OK. All right. An hour. A half hour."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:49:44.91","I think a half hour would probably be plenty of time. And then I have to ask you, what do you want to forget? I can do anything from giving you a suggestion to forget your name, to forget where you live, to-- what do you want to forget?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:49:58.08","Is it possible to forget everything, my whole self-identity? Is that too much?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:50:06.82","Well, I--"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","host","Scott Carrier","00:50:09.81","She took notes on what I wanted to forget. Then she hypnotized me, which involved having me count backwards from 100 and telling me to relax deeper and deeper, and then having me imagine being in a big garden with a stream running through it. And she said if I drank from the stream, I'd forget my name and where I was, and also the name of my friend who'd come with me. So I went and drank from the stream. And she woke me up."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:50:34.83","Five, open your eyes, all the way back, emerging from hypnosis, all the way back. Hi there."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:50:40.59","Hi."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:50:40.96","How you doing?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:50:41.88","Good."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:50:42.72","Feels pretty good, doesn't it?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:50:44.27","It was pleasant."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:50:45.88","Yeah."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:50:46.85","It was fun. But I think I can remember. I'm sorry."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:50:52.60","And what is it you can remember? What town do you live in?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:50:54.95","Salt Lake, sorry."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:50:56.45","And what have you been doing today?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:50:58.41","Um, working on this story."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:51:06.62","And what's his name over here?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:51:08.38","Trent Harris."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:51:09.32","[LAUGHTER]"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:51:11.67","I'm sorry, man. I tried. I did. I tried."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","host","Unspecified","00:51:20.85","The next day, I typed amnesia into a search engine on the World Wide Web and got a phone number for the Beckman Institute, a neuroscience center at the University of Illinois. I called up and talked to Rob Althoff, a graduate student. And he told me that the kind of amnesia I was looking for was indeed very rare and that there's some disagreement over whether it even happens at all."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","host","Unspecified","00:51:43.18","He said people do suffer long-term memory loss from severe brain injuries, but that usually, these people never recover their memories, that their brain doesn't regenerate. And he said that the other kind of amnesia, where there's no physical trauma, is often a matter of the person not wanting to remember, for one psychological reason or another, and that in these cases, it's really difficult to know whether the person is basically just faking it."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","host","Unspecified","00:52:14.40","Talking to Althoff made me wonder if amnesia, the kind we see on TV and in the movies, where a character gets hit on the head with a coconut, loses his self-identity and then spends the rest of the story rediscovering it or getting bonked on the head by another coconut, whether this is really just a story that we want to be true, that we somehow want to believe in it. The next thing I did was call Diane Bradshaw back and ask her if she knew anyone who could be easily hypnotized and wouldn't mind having amnesia. And she said yes, he's coming by this afternoon. If you came by around 4:00, we could ask him."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","host","Unspecified","00:52:49.23","So I went back and met Doug. And Doug was not only willing to be hypnotized, he told me that he'd actually had amnesia 10 years ago in Hawaii."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Doug","00:52:57.70","I was on my way from Haleiwa, which is the north shore of Hawaii. And I was on my way in to Waikiki. And there was a guy standing on the side of the road that had a towel wrapped around his head and had chicken blood, or I don't know what kind of blood. But he pulled over. He waved me over. And I pulled over my Volkswagen van."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Doug","00:53:18.61","And a bunch of guys came out of the cane field. And they just beat me. They beat me senseless. They broke almost every rib on the one side, punctured my lung with one of the ribs, punctured my lung, broke my jaw, broke my nose, and robbed me."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Doug","00:53:37.23","I was out. And they took me to the hospital, and I didn't regain consciousness for over 20 days. 21 days was when I finally woke up."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:53:47.44","So what was it like when you woke up?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Doug","00:53:52.70","I was scared. I've never been that scared in my life. I just didn't know how I got to where I was or who I was. And then as soon as I started to feel comfortable, just even a little bit comfortable, then I kind of was excited. I wanted to know everything. I wanted to know what this was and just everything. Because food, that was really wild. When they brought me ice cream, I was, ""Woo-hoo, boy, this is good. I like this. Bring more of this."""
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:54:25.47","So you couldn't remember food. You couldn't remember words, even. What kinds of things could you remember?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Doug","00:54:35.96","I remember I talked kind of a baby talk kind of thing, where it was a broken making words. My mind would think the word, but it wouldn't come down to my mouth. And I would-- [SLURRED SPEECH] --kinda talk like, like that, like that."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","host","Scott Carrier","00:55:08.64","It didn't take long for Diane to hypnotize him. He went down like a rock."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:55:12.98","In a moment, I'm going to say ""wide awake."" When I do, you will have no memory of who you are or where you are, gone completely. Wide awake. Open your eyes, wide awake. Hi there. What's your name? Where are you?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Doug","00:55:37.79","I don't know."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:55:38.92","You don't know. Did you know when you came in here?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Doug","00:55:47.21","I don't remember."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:55:48.69","You don't remember. Yeah."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:55:51.65","Ask him how it feels to not know who he is."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:55:55.49","Yeah. So hi. What's your name?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Doug","00:56:00.51","I don't know."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:56:01.76","What's it like not to know?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Doug","00:56:06.44","It's black."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Diane Bradshaw","00:56:07.37","It's black."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:56:09.47","How does that blackness make you feel? When you say black, what's the emotion?"
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","subject","Doug","00:56:17.40","Puzzled, and it's like I'm waiting for the projector to start at a movie. Like it's not on yet."
"42","Get Over It!","1996-11-15","4","Act 3","host","Scott Carrier","00:56:33.15","Watching Doug go through this, I couldn't decide whether it was real amnesia or whether it was just a performance of amnesia, and that maybe there's no difference. Doug said that getting beat up and losing his memory did help him turn his life around. If that's what he needed, if that's what we all need at some level, then it's no wonder people pretend it's more common than it really is."
