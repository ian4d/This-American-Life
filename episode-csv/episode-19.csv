"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","1","Act One. The Grizz","host","Ira Glass","00:00:00.94"," If you think about it, it's a strange thing for a very rich man to do to run for president because it means throwing yourself into a thousand tedious and potentially demeaning situations. For instance, you show up at a debate with the other millionaires who are running for president, and you try to make a joke out of the negative ads they are running against you. ""You didn't even use a good picture of me,"" you protest, ""so I brought you some pictures."" You wave a few snapshots into the air. You try to turn this debate into something on your own terms. You try to seize the moment."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","1","Act One. The Grizz","host","Ira Glass","00:00:41.29","You pass the photos to one of your millionaire opponents. He does not even look at them. He tells you that no pretty pictures are going to change your lousy record on taxes. You come off terribly. Another bad moment. Well, this actually happened to Bob Dole just last February. Bob Dole, now the presumptive Republican nominee to the presidency."

"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","1","Act One. The Grizz","host","Ira Glass","00:01:41.89","Act One concerns a politician you have probably never heard of. Act Two is a man who wrote a very strange letter to his yet unborn, yet unconceived, children. Act Three, another mixed legacy of a rich guy. Stay with us."

"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Ira Glass","00:03:05.20","And then, at some point, Michael Lewis became fascinated with some of the candidates that everyone else was ignoring. And by everyone else, I include both the reporters and the voters, OK? There were nine Republican candidates back in Iowa. And if you can name all nine of those candidates right now, I've got a crisp $100 bill right here in my hand. Call this station, and no, I'm not going to give you the phone number."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Ira Glass","00:03:38.50","Please consider now, when you consider these nine candidates, what could be a better subject for an entertaining, novelistic kind of writer than someone running for president who has pretty much no chance of making it? There you have a truly American story. There you have a classic American dreamer. And Lewis became so interested in one of these certain losers-- a guy named Morry Taylor-- that at some point, Lewis' editor got completely fed up with him and ordered him never to follow around Taylor anymore. ""I did not send you out there to write Morry Taylor's biography,"" the guy said."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Ira Glass","00:04:21.73","But it is easy to see why Lewis became so mesmerized with Taylor. Taylor would give away cash prizes to voters at his rallies. Taylor would burst onto stages reciting the words to his campaign theme song, Bruce Springsteen's ""Dancing in the Dark."" He would say, ""You need a spark to start a fire, and this gun's for hire."""
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Ira Glass","00:04:46.44","Taylor spent $6 million of his own money on the campaign. As Lewis points out, of nine Republican candidates, Taylor was the only one who had actually been a success in the real business world. Taylor began as a tool and die maker, bought failing companies, made them profitable. And by last year, his own company, Titan Tire and Wheel International-- I'll just say that name again, let's just pause on that name, Titan Tire and Wheel International-- tallied $620 million in revenue, no debt, and one of the highest profit margins of any company on the New York Stock Exchange."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Ira Glass","00:05:25.26","Morry Taylor has spent his whole life in the Midwest, and that is where Michael Lewis' diaries on him begin. Michael Lewis agreed to come into our studios and read."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:05:34.32"," January 11. Within minutes of landing in Des Moines, you know that you have arrived in the American Midwest. The Midwest is the straight man of the Western world, millions and millions of square miles peopled with Abbotts without their Costellos. It's not that Midwesterners lack a sense of humor. It's just that they regard humor as a second-rate behavior, the opposite of rather than a complement to seriousness. It's no wonder that professional Midwestern humorists like Garrison Keillor and David Letterman have a feel of men who have spun out of some orbit."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:06:07.92","I've come to Iowa to find Morry Taylor, the man who by a landslide won the hearts of the United We Stand delegates at Ross Perot's convention last fall. After hearing him speak, 400 of the 2,000 people present signed up to work on his campaign. The strange thing about Taylor is that he hasn't gotten more play in the press or the polls. He's the real thing, an extremely successful businessmen who has behaved about as well as an extremely successful businessman can."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:06:36.20","He employs 5,500 people at a wage rate of $12 to $17 an hour, all of whom are included in a profit sharing plan. He pays himself a modest salary and argues forcefully and often that CEOs of publicly held corporations should never be paid more than about 20 times the wages of their most menial workers. Actually, that's probably one of the reasons no one has heard of him until now."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:07:09.29","January 12. We start our day just before 8 o'clock inside a motor home plastered all over with Morry's favorite screaming eagle logo, the one his campaign staffers plead with him to abandon. A ferocious-looking bird flies out of the T in Morry's last name, which is painted in huge letters across the side of the colossal machine."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:07:31.24","Morry's campaign manager tried to talk him out of the expense, but Morry insisted that the best way to start running for president was to buy six RVs-- landyachts, they are called-- and race them in a convoy across each of Iowa's 99 counties and through every New Hampshire hamlet. Six monstrosities all jammed together and churning down the highway at 80 miles an hour with the Pointer Sisters blaring out of the lead vehicle, drowning out everything but Morry."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:07:59.29","Morry figured that he'd roll them into town, surround the courthouse, flip on the loudspeakers, tap a few kegs of beer, and everyone for miles would be talking about Morry Taylor for the next two weeks. He was right."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:08:12.08","Today, like every other day, Morry is wearing his American flag tie. He's shouting over music and the roar of the landyacht into a telephone at a radio talk show. ""Anyone who wants to come and help, call 1-800-USABEAR. The talk show host asks him some question. ""Well,"" replies Morry, ""I use the bear number because my nickname is The Grizz."""
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:08:37.75","""Why do they call you The Grizz?"" I ask after he hangs up. ""I got that when I took the company public,"" he shouts. ""At the closing, they gave me this plaque. It says-- and they did it in Latin, which language I can't speak, but this is what it says-- in North America, there is no known predator to the grizzly. So I became The Grizz. Then I thought about it. Up until that time, I kind of liked my other nickname, Attila. People think Attila the Hun was a barbarian, but he's not. He's the guy who ran the Roman legion out of town."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:09:20.70","At 9 o'clock, the landyacht rolls up beside the front door of the Ames High School and disgorges Morry. Morry then does his usual trick of startling the locals. He bursts through both double doors leading into the school, which, like all the doors he will open for the rest of the day, slam violently against the wall behind them. He marches off down a long corridor with the rest of us trying to keep up, leaving a trail of startled adolescents in his wake. He swaggers like a quarterback on the way to a huddle."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:09:50.12","""Did you play sports in high school?"" I ask Morry, or rather, the back of Morry's head. He doesn't even look around. He's shaking his head. I have no trouble imagining the scorn on his face. ""Did I play sports?"" he asks. ""I am the biggest jock who ever ran for president. I can beat you in anything."" And with that, he blows through the double doors leading into the auditorium."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:10:18.46","About 30 kids file in, slump down into their seats, and settle in for a snooze they'll never have. ""Your school is too big,"" booms Morry. ""This is what is wrong with America,"" he says, pointing at the kids. ""Big, big, big. A place like this breeds weirdos."""
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:10:39.54","The students are now fully alert. ""I never could enjoy going to a school like this,"" concludes Morry. The kids seem to concur. ""How many of you ever take accounting?"" he asks. The kids are now squirming and ducking. He's breaking down their resistance, making them nervous. Two hands go up. Morry shakes his head a little sadly."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:11:01.46","His tone changes. ""I know you've got a lot of these teachers."" He waves nonchalantly at a couple of uneasy-looking older men in the rafters. ""And they tell you a lot of--"" he doesn't use the word ""crap"" but he might as well-- ""things. But in your whole entire life, you're only going to use one or maybe two of those things."" He pauses and seems to reconsider. ""Now, we all agree that the most important thing in your life is your family,"" he says. ""Your mama and your daddy, your brothers and your sisters. But right after that, there's something else. We all know what it is, and it's green."""
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:11:45.97","With that, he reaches into his pocket and produces a fat roll of $100 bills. He holds it high so that everyone can see. Five grand, cash. The kids are now perched on the edge of their seats, giggling nervously. ""It all comes down to accounting,"" says Morry. ""Accounting and money. You can't live without it. And the minute you make it, someone is trying to take it away from you. So for god's sake, find out about money."""
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:12:14.96","""Can I have some?"" asks a kid in the front row. ""It's mine!"" shouts Morry and puts the money back in his pocket, a nice illustration of some general business principle."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:12:35.45","Morry's positions are somewhat quixotic. He's running on a platform of balancing the budget in 18 months, not by eliminating programs but by firing a third of the best-paid government employees. ""How many of you want to give the government 40% of what you earn after you get out of here?"" he asks the crowd. One of the kids raises his hand. ""Mark his name down,"" says Morry. ""An institution needs him. We're going to study his brain. He's not human. He's an alien."""
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:13:16.21","January 13. Tonight, we flew in one of Morry's private planes to a Republican county dinner at Storm Lake in Northwestern Iowa. After dinner, Morry rises to speak. He's on. Within minutes, he has the crowd laughing and clapping. They agree with him about everything, especially the lunacy of the Forbes tax plan. Then, in the midst of the fun, a woman rises and challenges his pro-choice position."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:13:41.96","""It's a religious issue,"" Morry says, ""not a matter for the federal government."" She presses him. You can see she's used to making public speakers either come around to her way of thinking or regret ever opening their mouths. She's picked the wrong guy today. Instead of backing down or wiggling, Morry goes on the attack."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:14:00.89","""Look, ma'am. I think 99% of women never want an abortion. They go through a lot of mental anguish. They suffer a lot. I say leave it to them."" She tries to speak. Morry interrupts. ""I said, leave it to the women."" And there, at a banquet filled with Republican party hacks, the sort of people who are meant to be rabidly pro-life, who Morry expected to be rabidly pro-life, a volcano of spontaneous applause erupted. All over the room, women were clapping so hard I thought they'd break their hands. Here, I thought, is the benefit of having someone around who feels free to speak his mind. He liberates, however momentarily, those who don't."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:14:56.63","January 14. I was waiting at the front desk of the Des Moines YMCA when Morry arrived just before 9:00 AM. ""What, do you think I wouldn't show?"" he says. The racquetball game took just under 22 minutes. Morry won, 15-zip, 15-5. I had figured that between the 25 extra pounds he's carrying around and the 16 years he has on me, I could out-hustle him. I was wrong. He knew every angle and trick on the court and played each one with relish. ""Too good,"" he'd shout after he'd drop the ball into the corner for the 10th time."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","2","Act Two. Citizen Kane","host","Michael Lewis","00:15:31.68","As the rout progressed, he shouted to his aides. ""14 to zip. Not bad for an old guy,"" he shouted. And then, under his breath, ""Some of my guys are betting on you. Dip [BLEEP]."" As we crawl through the hole out the back of the court, he says, ""Don't you go write that you lost because you were nervous a presidential candidate was going to have a heart attack."" Camus identified the love of winning at games as one of the prerequisites of happiness in the modern world. And he did that without ever meeting Morry."

"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","subject","Jack Hitt","00:26:12.25"," So here's what the lawsuit's about. The lawsuit is the existing kids want to destroy the sperm, all of it. 15 vials ""assiduously"" deposited, as we know. In the course of their complaint, the existing kids say that they seek to, quote, ""prevent the disruption of existing families by after-born children."""
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:26:36.29"," ""After-born children."" There's another new-- this case, in terms of what it's doing to the English language, is just groundbreaking. Forget about what it does to the law. ""After-born children."""
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","subject","Jack Hitt","00:26:48.07"," Now, all of this is complicated by the fact that Debbie is 38 years old in 1991. And she makes the claim that she must have the sperm at once because of advanced maternal age."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:27:03.70"," Right. In other words, if she gets a little bit older, she's not going to be able to have any babies."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","subject","Jack Hitt","00:27:06.87"," So now, the court realizes that they've got a big issue at hand here. What is sperm? Is it property? Is it something bigger? I mean, it exists, at least symbolically, on this kind of Darwinian level about preservation of species and perpetuation of one's own genetic line. And they're very nervous about just saying, let's just destroy this sperm. They don't really want to do that. That's clear."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:27:35.99"," Wait, let me just be sure I understand this. Because if they say that sperm is property, his wife and children probably can lay some sort of claim to it or say that this is property, and we have some sort of final word over this property. But if it is somehow part of his personhood, then it transcends the category of property."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","subject","Jack Hitt","00:27:54.96"," Right. And so they go back to the precedent. And they find some law regarding human tissue. But most of the law regarding that says that once tissue has left your body, then it can be destroyed. It's not yours anymore because who cares, right?"
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","subject","Jack Hitt","00:28:11.72","But they point out that you can't just say that about this particular tissue because Mr. Kane, as we know, ""assidulously deposited"" these particular tissues outside of his body with the intention that it be used for procreation. It's not just, like, sperm sitting around. It's sperm sitting around with great intent. You understand what I'm saying? Intent to become a child."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:28:37.11"," I charge you of sperm with intent."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","subject","Jack Hitt","00:28:39.99"," Yes, right. Possession of sperm with the intent to inseminate. OK, so elsewhere in this case, the two existing kids plead with the court that it's just weird to have a kid after you're dead."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:28:56.31"," Is that the word they use, or is that just kind of what it comes down to?"
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","subject","Jack Hitt","00:28:59.23"," Well, no. They just say it's just wrong. They don't know what else to say."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:29:04.27"," They just say, we all can just look at each other in the eye and we know what we mean we say this is just too weird. That's what it comes down to."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","subject","Jack Hitt","00:29:11.76"," Exactly. Yeah. And in a funny way, on that level, I completely understand them. So the court reflects on this issue historically and points out something that you probably did not know, which is that, quote, ""According to the Napoleonic Code from the early 19th century, any child born more than 300 days after the putative father's death is deemed illegitimate,"" end quote. And what that means is that the guy goes off to war, he gets killed."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","subject","Jack Hitt","00:29:40.85","Well, the clock starts ticking the last day he was in town. And 300 days after that-- in other words, nine months of pregnancy-- any child born after that can't claim the father's goods. In other words, nine months after the guy's dead, his estate is closed and shut, right? But this is where this case gets very troubling because it keeps it open for potentially ever. As long as the sperm is sitting in the bank with great intent, the estate can't be closed."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:30:11.43"," So in other words, what seems like a very simple, though odd, family dispute actually raises quite a broad and profound question of the law."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","subject","Jack Hitt","00:30:21.39"," Absolutely. In fact-- and I'll get to this in just a second because there's another thing here that might make your heart stop when I tell you what it is-- this thing, at first when I first read it, I thought OK, this is just a funny little case. No, no, no. This is overthrowing millennia of settled common law, in a funny way. Now, the existing kids, they make all these claims. But there's some that you just have to hear just to think about."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","subject","Jack Hitt","00:30:51.00","One is, quote, ""The child could suffer psychologically from being conceived by a dead man."" Now, I never really thought about that. But imagine if you grew up, and you knew that your father died five years before you were conceived. It's not like being adopted or where your parentage is somewhat mysterious. That's kind of glamorous in its own way. And at least it's a story you can tell yourself. You can fantasize about who your parents might have been."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:31:23.23"," No, no. Well, I mean--"

You don't think that being conceived by a dead man-- I don't care what the mother's explanation is. I'm sort of on the existing kids' side on this particular part of the argument. It's just strange."

He ""checked out"" because of all ""the Kellys of the world"" and all that. He couldn't even hang five years to see this kid into kindergarten, OK? I mean, I don't know. To me, something about being dead before you were conceived is very weird."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","subject","Jack Hitt","00:32:57.30","OK, here's what's beautiful. What's the resolution eventually? This court dilly dallies and hands it off to another court. But that court finally says, you know what? It's property. Frozen sperm is a special class of property. And so we divide it up according to the rules of the will. 20% goes to Deborah, 80% goes to the two existing kids. So Deborah got three of the 15 vials of sperm. And presumably, the existing children, not that they had anything to do with it, received 12 vials."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","subject","Jack Hitt","00:33:30.66","Then Deborah apparently, at age 42, last year, went into a clinic and proceeded to engage in the first instance in American law of post-mortem insemination.

As I said earlier, death was always the key indicator that an estate could be closed out. But now this loophole, frozen sperm, opens a door that could just keep these post-mortem lawsuits going for decades. It reminds me my friend, Peg Perry. She lives in Northern Connecticut and raises milk cows. And one time, I was up there visiting, and she was inseminating some of the cows. And it turns out the bull semen that she uses is from this bull. He had a name like Ferdinand."

"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One. A Candidate, A Voter, And A Room Full Of Pigs","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:34:48.22"," He died in the '50s?"

"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","3","Act One.

And one of the winners of the $5,000 was a pig farmer named Wilfred McCreedy who just happened to be the host of the Iowa caucus for Republicans in the little town where he lived.

But in the flesh, his anger comes across differently. At some level, he may be angry. But his prejudice seems mainly to give him pleasure. As he lays into Clinton, homosexuals, and the US government, his real emotion is more like delight, the delight of a good fan rooting for his team. Go straights!"

""That man took pornographic photographs of homosexuals,"" bellows Mr. McCreedy, at which point Mrs. McCreedy just rolls her eyes. I've tried to make myself as agreeable as possible, but it's only a matter of time before I have to come clean with my left-leaning associations. The tension builds as Mr. McCreedy stakes out a political position on the other end of the spectrum from mine. But it's nearly two hours before I discover that the McCreedys have no idea where I am from or what I do, only that I am a friend of Morry Taylor's."

I have no idea what she's talking about. ""People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,"" she explains. ""You just never know when they're going to interrupt.

As far as these people knew, I was some protester who had come to disrupt their lives. And yet they still fed me and humored me before venturing to ask. One of the few things I recall from college was that in the Homeric universe, the mark of a civilized persons is his kindness to strangers. The good king feeds Odysseus first, then asks questions later. The cyclops questions him first, then tries to eat him. The McCreedys have the gift of kindness to strangers. I put PETA on the list of things to be against."

Neither of us wants to put a fine point on political disagreement, and so I've been granted the status of conservative by association. After a bit, Mr. McCreedy announces that it's time to ""go choring."" On the way over in the car, he gives me an idea of what it's like to host a caucus. In the past couple of days, Phil Gramm has called six times, Pat Buchanan twice, and Alan Keyes once. Lamar Alexander has sent McCreedy two books about himself and a videotape. Pollsters call the McCreedys about eight times a day."

""Maybe it's one of those shirts from Alexander,"" he says, laughing. It is, or at least it's a collection of Alexandriana. At length, I ask him who he's for. ""I'm undecided,"" he says. ""A week ago, I was for Forbes. Then I got my check. I was for Morry Taylor. Now I don't know. You've got to find me one who's going to beat Bill Clinton. Which one do you think?""

But he's a good sport about it. He's unhappy for about four seconds, and then he's rueful. At length, we arrive at the pig sheds, long, low-slung buildings lined with six-by-five-foot metal troughs filled to the brim with oinkers. McCreedy opens the first door. I recoil and gag. The blast of odor is the most moving thing I've experienced on the campaign trail since I last heard Alan Keyes speak."

Only three are even mentioned-- Richard Lugar, Bob Dole, and Alan Keyes. From the sounds of their talk, the people in the room are divided between Keyes and Dole. Just before 8 o'clock, Mr. McCreedy passes around a pad of yellow post-its. Two men then collect the votes in a silver pot and adjourn to the dining room table. There, they quietly add the totals. Dole, 11. Keyes, 7. Alexander, four. Lugar, three."

When the tally is announced to the room, there is a murmur. And then someone shouts, ""Wilfred, does that mean you've got to give the $5,000 back?"" It's clear they all think that Morry was a fool. He spent $5,000 on the guy, and he couldn't even buy his vote. I prefer to see it another way. Who else but Morry Taylor could give a guy $5,000 and still leave him free to vote for whom he pleases?"

Well, now we know what happens when an honest and genuinely free man with a heart of gold runs for president. He spends $6.5 million and gets 7,000 votes.

How should we think about them? Take Ron Brown. Ron Brown is someone who could have had a comfortable, low-stress life. But he is one of those people who threw himself into difficult tasks like, for example, taking over the Democratic Party at one of its lowest moments, uniting it, raising tons of money for it. And when his plane went down, it was a tragedy. But some people have been disturbed at the way many are now eulogizing the former Secretary of Commerce."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","4","Act Three. Another Mixed Legacy","host","Ira Glass","00:53:29.10","Brian Gilmore is a legal services attorney in Washington, DC, a writer, and a poet. And he says that in this moment, when so many people have been praising this successful, powerful man as a kind of post-Martin Luther King saint and role model, his feelings are more complicated."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","4","Act Three. Another Mixed Legacy","host","Brian Gilmore","00:53:48.99"," I would be a liar if I said I was a political disciple of Ron Brown. In fact, I cannot ever recall thinking that his particular approach to politics was the answer for the widening woes of black America, or anyone who is deprived in this society, for that matter. It might enable a few privileged, upper-middle-class African-Americans to get richer or gain a foothold into the walls of power and might provide some jobs to a small segment of the population, but I have grave doubts that this approach alone can ever change the fundamental problems the masses of African-Americans face on a daily basis."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","4","Act Three. Another Mixed Legacy","host","Brian Gilmore","00:54:28.71","But despite this glaring difference in our political ideals, I was deeply saddened by the death of the man who I admired greatly and who was clearly a role model for me. In his own way, on his own terms, he seemed to solve the W.E.B. DuBois dilemma of double consciousness that we African-Americans are born with and face our every waking moment in this country. He was a man who mastered the art of floating carefully between black America and white America. His way of accomplishing this most difficult task was to get inside the huddle and become a player in American politics and society."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","4","Act Three. Another Mixed Legacy","host","Brian Gilmore","00:55:08.35","Though my life is seemingly taking a vastly different path than his, I have to admit that in a lot of ways, Brown and I are very similar. Both of us were born in Washington, DC, attended private schools where middle-class kids were urged to succeed. And like him, I, too, have become a lawyer. But that is where many of our similarities end. Ron Brown was a partner in a law firm that represented some of the richest clients in the world. I have been an attorney for the past three years representing some of Washington's poorest and most destitute residents."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","4","Act Three. Another Mixed Legacy","host","Brian Gilmore","00:55:45.61","Brown came along at that brief, magical time in American history when the civil rights movement had reshaped the country and opportunities for educated African-Americans seemed to be unlimited. He worked for a traditional civil rights organization, the Washington Urban League, and eventually became part of Edward Kennedy's congressional staff. Like so many other minority professionals at that time, he honestly believed in America and its opportunities following the '60s."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","4","Act Three. Another Mixed Legacy","host","Brian Gilmore","00:56:13.91","By contrast, when I came along in search of my position in the world, Ronald Reagan had become president, and the civil rights movement was over. My friends and I were convinced he was going to cut all educational funding for African-Americans and make us join the Army. I can never forget hearing, while I was in college, of the Reagan administration's open assault on educational grants and social programs that would ultimately change the face of the country."
"19","Rich Guys","1996-04-12","4","Act Three. Another Mixed Legacy","host","Brian Gilmore","00:56:43.59","To me, Ron Brown represented a certain type of African-American politician, the kind that emerged from the riots of the '60s, with so much promise in the '70s, only to watch black communities nationwide crumble and self-destruct in the '80s under Reagan."
