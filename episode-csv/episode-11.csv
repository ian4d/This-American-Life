Two weeks ago, we had a show where Julia Sweeney told the story of getting cancer. And she told the story of herself getting cancer and of her brother getting cancer.

It's a club in Los Angeles where essentially, comics come each week, and they tell what are basically comic diary versions of their week."

"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:07:09.00","Dave and I became friends in fourth grade, and we were friends through sixth grade. And I have to describe him physically because that's a huge part of his personality. He was-- and he still is-- an extremely wiry person. Very thin. He looks emaciated. And he also, his skin is like a jaundiced yellow color. He was always very acned. Just very pale, pasty, and he just looked sick."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:07:42.92","I don't really know how we became friends. We were in class together in grade school. But as things progressed into fifth grade, it became pretty clear that our friendship was the most intense friendship in the class. We would talk on the phone at least once a day and for hours. We would just talk for hours and just make each other laugh so hard. And that was why we always got separated in class was just because we weren't troublemakers, we just made each other laugh a lot. We had very similar senses of humor."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:08:15.51","The scatological jokes were the primary jokes. And I was just thinking about this today. I remembered this one thing that we used to do, which we did obsessively. It's embarrassing to say it, but we were obsessed with the words ""poop"" and ""pee."" And we made this little thing where I would say ""poop"" and he would say ""pee,"" and then he would say ""wee,"" and then I would say ""gilly gee."" And so it'd go kind of like, poop, pee, wee, gilly gee. And we said this over and over and over again. And we used to just take books and just insert the words ""poop"" and ""pee"" everywhere."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:08:56.41","And ""wee"" was like the one word that was just, for some reason, that was like our rallying call. That was like our motto. We just said it all the time. Just ""wee."" Wee! We used to do that all the time. Wee!"

"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:09:38.45","I basically discovered sexuality through him. And we used to play spin the bottle in his room. And we would take off an article of clothing when it would land on us. And it was the first time we'd ever been naked in front of another person except for our parents. And it was petrifying, but it was also just this whole discovery period of seeing another man naked there."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:10:07.28","And it became this whole game that we played often. And we would revel in the fact of standing there in front of each other totally naked, assuming these characters like, ""Hi, Mr. Jones. How are you? Nice to meet you."" Businessmen and everything, just standing there completely buck naked and so terrified that we were ever going to get caught, because his parents were always home. They were always in the house and everything, and we were just so afraid that someone was going to knock on the door."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:10:35.23","The one time that was the biggest scare was he-- Dave basically could get anybody to do anything that he wanted them to do. And he had a camera and was-- these times when I'd go up to his house were fully documented events. He's very anal retentive. And he loved documenting everything was going on."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:11:00.92","So he would have a camera and take a lot of pictures. And he wanted me to pull down my pants and take a picture of me with my pants down. And I was refusing to do it. I would not let it be caught on film. And he was just insisting, and he went through this entire-- I mean, he was trying to coax me for so long, telling me all these different things that he was going to do for me and saying, ""Oh, nobody's going to see it."" And he came up with this whole scheme of how nobody would see the film and everything and just these elaborate, elaborate plans on how nobody would see these pictures. And I just kept refusing and refusing and refusing."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:11:39.54","And finally, at the end of it, he was like, ""All right, just take down you pants anyway. I won't take a picture. I swear to you. I won't take a picture, I promise."" And I still didn't believe him. And he was like, ""Look, I promise. I promise. I promise,"" This went on for like an hour, of him trying to coax me to take my pants down. And he promised me, bottom of his heart, that he was not going to take a picture."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:11:57.50","And so I was like, fine. So I like unbuckled my belt, and I unbuckled my pants. And I pulled down my zipper, and I whipped open my pants. And I had my underwear on. And then I put myself all back together again. And when I had my pants open, he took a picture. And I was like, ""Ah!"""
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:12:11.21","And I was terrified because when you're that age, when you're 11 and 12 years old, you can't go in and get your pictures developed yourself and pay for them and get them. And I thought, somebody is going to get these pictures developed, and somebody is going to see them."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:12:23.32","So weeks later, I was going up to his house again. And in the car going up to his house-- his mother was driving-- he was like, ""I got the pictures back."" And I said, ""Oh, my god."" And he was like, ""You're not going to believe what's on there."" And I said, ""But what can be? You didn't see anything."" And he's like, ""I know, but you have to see this because it's there."" And I was like, ""But it can't be because I didn't take my pants down."" And he was like, ""I know, but it's there. It's there. You have to see it."""
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:12:52.62","He pulls out the pictures, and I looked at it. And my penis was hanging out there. And I was like, ""But I didn't do it."" And he was like, ""You must've."" And I said, ""But I know I didn't. I know I just opened my pants."" And he said, ""You must've done it. Maybe it just fell out or something."" And I said, ""But it can't be."" And we racked our brains just trying to figure out what had happened, because I knew that I hadn't pulled my underwear down."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:13:17.96","So that night, we were at a high school football game. And we were looking at the pictures again, just examining them. We were way up in the bleachers in a corner. And we took them out, and we were looking at them. And we were trying to explain what had happened. And finally, we figured out that it was the inside of my belt that looked like my penis."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:13:35.52","And we're like, ""Oh!"" And so I was completely relieved, but I made him-- I watched him just tear up the picture into a thousand pieces and went through this whole elaborate method to bury the pieces in the bottom of a trash can at this football stadium. And I was still petrified that somebody was going to find them and piece them together."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:14:00.80","The point that it started to change was, as we were going into sixth grade, we were constantly being separated in class. And that's around the time when people start to realize that there's a difference between someone who's straight and someone who's gay. And there was just grumblings happening. People were accusing us of being homosexual."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:14:28.11","And we weren't in any way, but we also knew of all the things that we had done with each other in each other's presence. And I think when people started to think that we were gay, that just rose to the surface, and we realized that there was a cool thing and a not cool thing. And we were definitely not cool in the friendship that we were in."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:14:54.92","And that's also around that time when-- in my town, at least, and I think in a lot of small towns-- is where sports just become the most important thing in your life. And I was not a good athlete then at all. Dave was a good athlete. And Dave organized a big football party one weekend where we were going to go out there and play football and have a sleepover and then the next day, play more football."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:15:28.58","Dave just organized this thing unbelievably. He had jerseys printed up with numbers and names on them. He had teams with rosters. He had practice for his team with plays. There was a playbook. This is for a little football game, like three-on-three football or four-on-four football. Touch football."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:15:50.37","And every single minute was decided upon beforehand by him as to what we would do, where we would be, what we would eat, the food we would eat, when we would play football. It was all timed out. He was so organized and anal retentive about it. I don't remember very well, but I can't imagine that I played tremendously well."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","2","Act Two. Dave's Hatred","host","Bob","00:16:15.23","I was thinking about this today. I was trying to think of the moment when everything changed. And I'm almost positive it was that event. It was the football party. And immediately after that, he just totally stopped talking to me."

"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Ira Glass","00:20:29.98"," Act Two, Dave's Hatred. Dave and Bob were best friends. And now Dave started using all the tactics that adults use in political situations, in power situations, all the tactics one uses to turn people against one another. Whispering in ears, things like that. Bob, who's now a theater director in New York City, by the way, Bob tells the story."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:20:55.72","I remember going into class in seventh grade on the first day of school and him not talking to me and everybody just wondering. The whole school was wondering why there was this big fight going on between Dave and Bob. And I remember not having an answer for anybody. I used to tell them to ask Dave. I had no idea. And I used to tell people that he just stopped talking to me. And I remember that he became completely bent on turning everyone against me. The whole school. And he did it very well because he's so organized and because he's so manipulative."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:21:35.00","And I saw him. And I saw him telling people to say things to me. And he was one who formed the I Hate-- they used to call me [? Cooze ?] then. And he was the one who formed the I Hate [? Cooze ?] Club. He never did anything to me himself. He would never come up to me and make fun of me. He would never come up to me and hit me. He would never assault me personally. But he would just get everyone else to do it for him."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:22:02.42","So he would send people to say things to me. I remember one time in the lunchroom Sam saying, have you ever been caught masturbating? And of course, either answer is-- you damn yourself if you answer yes or if you answer no. And I remember hearing Dave tell him to ask me that."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:22:27.45","I used to just get made fun of horrendously by everyone. People would make fun of the way that I chewed at lunch. People would make fun of the way that I laughed. People would make fun of the way that I coughed, that I sneezed. People would make fun of the way that I walked. There was just this teasing. But that makes it even sound less violent than it was. It was just a mocking. It was a very pointed mocking on everyone's part."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:22:59.85","I remember sitting alone at the lunch table with no one to talk to and just wanting so badly for no one to turn their attention to me because I knew that the attention would be negative. I remember not understanding what was going on. I had been in such a sweet position with this person. We had such a good friendship. And then, all of a sudden, everyone had just turned against me."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:23:27.96","And he wasn't like a pied piper. He was so subtle, and he was so quiet. I don't think he ever had a friendship with people like he had with me. But he was just able to organize people into these different factions. He would just say, ""Go over to [? Cooze ?] and just shove him into a locker."" And they'd go do it."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:23:58.43","That was the worst period, I think, of my entire life was that period. I used to go home from school and cry after school. I used to go to my dog and hug my dog and say, you are my only friend in the world."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:24:15.19","Then he started to kind of needle me. I remember one thing that he did was there was this guy, Mike, in my class. And Mike was what we called in my hometown a scummer, which meant that he was on welfare. He perhaps didn't have a pair of pants for every day of the week. He was very smart, which was a strike against him at that age. And he just didn't fit in. He was a real geek. So Dave organized this fight between Mike and I-- a fist fight to prove who was the bigger faggot. Whoever would lose was the bigger faggot."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:24:59.79","And he positioned us-- he spun it so there was no way I could not fight. If I didn't have this fight, then things would just get worse for me. Things would get worse. Mike was at the bottom of the barrel, and I was there with him. And Dave had to prove that I was below him. And so he organized this whole fight. And everyone in the class was like, ""Are you going to fight Mike? Are you going to fight Mike?"""
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:25:24.96","And I finally conceded. I conceded to fight him. Dave organized the whole event. It was to happen at this playground. And we went, and he tried to get this whole audience to come and see it. Unfortunately, nobody came but him-- well, I guess, fortunately. Nobody came but him and one other person."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:25:47.22","So Mike and I went there. And neither of us wanted to fight each other. Neither of us had any reason in the world to fight each other. So I just remember standing there facing him, just laughing, just like, what are we supposed to do? We're standing here. We've been forced into this just to save our own souls. And now we have to inflict pain on each other. And we stood there for the longest time. And Dave kept trying to push us into fighting. He was saying, ""Come on. Just throw a punch. Just throw a punch. Just start."""
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:26:15.24","We waited for the longest time, and then finally, I was just like, this is ridiculous. So I went up, and I shoved him. And then we started to fight. We weren't really into fighting, but we had to do it then. And I pushed him at one point, and he fell backwards and he hurt his wrist. And I got on top of him. and I held his wrist. And I remember saying to him, ""Do you give up?"" And he wouldn't give up. And I was holding his wrist back."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:26:41.23","And each time I kept asking if he was going to give up, and he kept saying no. And each time he'd say no, I'd bend his wrist back a little bit more. And he was crying in pain. And I kept saying, I'm going to bend it back. I'm going to bend it back. I'm going to bend it back, thinking, I don't want to break this person's wrist. I have no reason to break this person's wrist."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:26:58.74","And I was faced at that moment with either giving up and getting kicked even more or going ahead with really hurting this person and hoping that it would save me in some way. And I broke his wrist. He came in the next day into school with a cast on. I don't know how his family paid for his cast. And everybody saw that and said, ""You idiot, [? Cooze! ?] What did you do? You idiot!"" And it made it even worse."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:27:44.69","I just didn't understand. I didn't know what was going on. That's the most frustrating for me, even still today. I always thought it was me. I always thought it was something I was doing. I thought it was the way that I wore my clothes. I thought it was the shoes that I wore. I thought it was the way that I laughed. I remember."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:28:00.37","And I remember I tried to change these things. I tried not to laugh so loud. I tried to cough differently. They made fun of the most minuscule things that are just human, like chewing. If they would've noticed the way that I breathed, they would have made fun of that. I remember I tried lifting weights. And it was impossible, because there was nothing I could do to make them change their minds. If I lifted weights, it was the way that I lifted weights. They would come up with something."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:28:32.79","It was a no-win situation. And I guess I knew how smart he was, and I knew how well he knew me. And I guess, all of a sudden, I had thought that he had seen all these things in me that were just wrong, just so not cool."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:28:54.40","I remember very clearly there was a moment that the clouds just cleared and everything became possible. I went to the Pennsylvania Governor's School for the Arts in my junior year. The summer between my junior and senior year, that was when I met people who were actors, like I was, who were my age and who respected me."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:29:20.52","And I remember very clearly, it was after lunch, and people who were in my theater class, we were going down to the cafeteria. And I had forgotten my bag in the cafeteria. And I said, ""Oh, just wait for me one second. I just want to get my bag."" And I went down to the cafeteria, and I got my bag. And I came back up, and they were still there waiting for me. And I remember so distinctly remembering, ""Oh, my god. These people, they waited for me."""
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:29:47.41","That meant so much to me, because I felt like I'm not this idiot. I'm not this geek. I'm not a person who everyone should hate. I'm actually a pretty good human being, and people like me."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:30:05.59","Sometimes, I feel like there's some justice in the fact that I'm surrounded now by many people who love me and respect me.

"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Bob","00:30:24.49","And when I go back home and I see people looking at me the way that they looked at me in high school, I think there is some justice in this, because those people are probably-- some of those people, I've heard, are in bad situations with their families. They've got wives they don't love. They've been through divorces. They don't have any friends. They're in the same bar they were in four or five years ago, drinking the same beer they drank. And their gut is a little bigger, and their nose is a little redder. And they just look tired. And I feel like my life is in pretty good shape, and I'm happy. And that's the sweetest revenge. And last Christmas, I ran into him at a mall. And he looked more jaundiced and more sickly than ever."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","3","Act Three. Dave's Response","host","Ira Glass","00:31:20.85"," Bob says that it was because Dave made him an outcast in junior high school that he ended up spending a lot of time with the theater teacher. Because the other kids wouldn't talk to him. And this teacher put him in plays and took him to plays in New York City, showing him that there was a bigger world outside their hometown."

"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","4","Act Four. Another Dave","subject","Bob","00:43:34.01"," I don't know, I have no reason to feel lonely about this. I don't expect Dave to remember it. What you're saying sounds like I should have animosity toward him because of what he did to me."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","4","Act Four. Another Dave","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:43:45.59"," No, I don't mean animosity at all. Actually, in fact, just the opposite. Simply someone else to confirm that it happened. That it happened and that it had a meaning."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","4","Act Four. Another Dave","subject","Bob","00:43:55.45"," Yeah. Yeah, you may be right. Now I feel alone. [LAUGHS] I mean, yeah, I can see myself saying, ""But, Dave, don't you remember?"" This was a massive event in my life."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","4","Act Four. Another Dave","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:44:27.17","As you were talking, I was thinking this is the Gabriel Garcia Marquez part of the story where, like, is memory lost? Does memory last? Does it mean anything if an entire nation forgets what it was? Or does it mean anything if we are the only one who remembers an experience and then we are lost, and so that experience is never remembered? Does it mean anything? And you're saying, really, no. Maybe it meant something to me, but no, not really."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","4","Act Four. Another Dave","subject","Bob","00:44:54.60"," And I can assure you that I am like-- I'm going to pronounce his name wrong, it's Jorge Luis Borges. Like he says, I'm remembering the last time I remembered it, which was a memory of the last time I remembered it, which is a memory of the last time I remembered it. It increasingly gets more and more dramatic, and the moment gets refined down to-- it gets distilled down into something which becomes very palatable and very understandable."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","4","Act Four. Another Dave","host","Ira Glass","00:45:27.90"," One loose end in the whole thing, of course, was the friend, the mysterious friend. Remember, Dave said that Bob was to blame for them becoming enemies in the seventh grade by making friends with a guy who, we were told, is named Mike, though not the Mike whose wrist Bob later broke."
"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","4","Act Four. Another Dave","subject","Bob","00:45:47.63"," I can sort of understand that. I know which Mike you're referring to, and I know that we did start to become friends then. But the friendship that I had with Dave was always the strongest friendship that I ever had up until probably five years ago when I met the person who I consider my best friend now. He always used to use the term ""false friend"" in seventh and eighth grade. I remember that clearly. He used to always say I was his ""false friend."""

"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","4","Act Four. Another Dave","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:46:25.22"," See, to me, false friend means that he thinks that you betrayed him."

"11","Enemies","1996-01-24","4","Act Four. Another Dave","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:46:46.97"," That it was a complete misunderstanding."

There's her former excuse for a boyfriend, Randy Sykes, for example. The boyfriend who, after Trish accidentally backed her car over his dog, practically beat her senseless. He beat her with words, but still, it might as well have been with his fists. He struck her again and again with words and names such as ""manipulative,"" ""jealous,"" ""childish,"" and others I wouldn't justify in print. The dog's death was a tragic accident, but perhaps also a blessing in disguise, as Randy tended to spend entirely too much time with it."

Seen standing together in the parking lot of the Burger Tabernacle-- her home away from home-- and seen huddled together, laughing on the escalator of the Crabtree Valley Mall. Annette, my supposed best friend, who secretly wanted and coveted everything I owned. Is everyone on earth as two-faced as Annette Kelper? Is everyone as cruel as Randy Sykes? I think not."

Randy Sykes' drip is the size of my little finger, and that's when it's hard. And I'm not counting the nail-- just the finger. He had sex two times with a boy at Camp Ticonderoga when he was in junior high school. Maybe that explains why he loves it with somebody sticks their finger up his [? couvade. ?] He used to beg me to do that, but I refused. I said, ""No way, Randy.""
