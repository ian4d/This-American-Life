"41","Politics","1996-11-08","1","Act One. Life in the White House","subject","Rosemary Eckersley","00:00:12.47"," And we do that year round. And, of course, coffee is very mandatory. [LAUGHS]"

"41","Politics","1996-11-08","1","Act One. Life in the White House","subject","Rosemary Eckersley","00:00:22.70"," Well, the usual. I go fight with the face and Max Factor and my husband goes off to the office."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","1","Act One. Life in the White House","host","Ira Glass","00:00:30.84"," The office in this case is not the Oval Office. No, she spends more time there. He drives into San Francisco where he has an office for his business in international finance. The couple who live in this house are named Norman Eckersley and Rosemary Ashley Eckersley. Neither is a member of the Democratic Party. Both have lots more money than the President of the United States. And the White House-- this one, anyway-- is about 15 miles south of San Francisco in a suburb called Hillsborough."

"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","host","Ira Glass","00:01:33.75"," My tour guide at the Western White House-- this White House-- was the real estate agent who's trying to sell the thing, Ann Riley. And she began the tour with a packet of old photos and press clippings that she'd assembled."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","subject","Ann Riley","00:01:46.94"," This is really quite a fascinating home, and it has had several lives. It started off this."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:01:56.05"," Originally, this just looks like just a regular big old house."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","subject","Ann Riley","00:01:58.82"," It was a Victorian. It was an old Victorian. Here it is in the beginning."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","host","Ira Glass","00:02:04.39"," The house has been around for over half the life of the United States. And it's the kind of huge structure that reflects every prevailing fashion over time. It's been redesigned in the neoclassical style, the French Normandy style, as a massive Swiss chalet, as a Mediterranean home with a tile roof."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","host","Ira Glass","00:02:21.97","And finally, in 1930, George Hearst, the oldest son of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, bought this place and hired Julia Morgan, the architect who designed Hearst's castle-- San Simeon-- to turn this house into a facsimile of the White House. Why? Ann Riley says the best guess anybody has is this."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","subject","Ann Riley","00:02:41.44"," Julia Morgan's charge was to deliver a house that he could invite the presidents to stay in when they came to the West Coast. So that's the myth. And I say it's a story."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:02:54.83"," And we actually don't know exactly why he decided. There's no documentation or quotes or anything from him saying, ""Here is why I'm going to do this."""
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","subject","Ann Riley","00:03:01.83"," Well, his father, you know, had all these wonderful Hollywood starlets cavorting all over San Simeon. There was all this great stuff going on. And I think George was just trying to rise to the occasion. So what else would be famous besides a movie starlet? Well, the presidents of the United States might give him a little muscle in the family feud. It just feels so ""mmm."""
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:03:26.10"," And once your dad builds Hearst Castle, what are you going to do?"
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","host","Unspecified","00:03:30.65"," It's not an exact duplicate. Yes, there's an oval office. Yes, there's a rose garden. Yes, the columns in the window bays. the fireplace mantles, and the pediments above doors are modeled on those at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But it's more of a kind of tribute to the White House than a copy. From the outside, it reminds you of the White House the way that Madonna resembles Ava Peron. They're shooting for the same effect. There's a strong resemblance. But the copy just doesn't have the gravitas of the original."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","subject","Ann Riley","00:04:00.36"," Now, this is a fun room. Upstairs play room. Painted bright red slashed with silver paint. Ping pong tables, exercise equipment, massage table."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:04:15.27"," And again, this is, like, a lacquer red room."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","subject","Ann Riley","00:04:21.40"," Actually, this is a carpet that lights up. It has lights in it."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:04:26.43"," What?"
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","subject","Ann Riley","00:04:27.15"," This carpet lights up. I don't know how to turn it on. But do you see all those little pinholes?"
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:04:32.71"," Yeah."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","subject","Ann Riley","00:04:33.66"," Those actually can be turned on."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","host","Ira Glass","00:04:36.36"," The owners of this White House reflect the times just as clearly as the occupants of that other White House back East do. During the last century, they included one of the men who founded banks in California and financed the railroad's expansion through the West. And the owner of the shoe company that made Buster Browns. In 1972, it was rumored that John Lennon and Yoko Ono would be moving in."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","host","Ira Glass","00:04:55.85","As for the current owners, they made their money the way people do these days. He comes from the world of international banking, she from Hollywood. She was the wife of a studio vice president and the wife of a plastic surgeon before this marriage. When I meet her, she descends a staircase telling a slightly off-color and actually very funny joke. Before an hour's up, she's told me why Jean Harlow used to put ice on her breasts, why there are nude calendar girl paintings of herself over the beds in the house, and some story that Jane Russell told her the other night at dinner. I liked her."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","subject","Rosemary Eckersley","00:05:24.44"," You know the old song-- Cyndi Lauper-- ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun."" That's me. I think that if we can't enjoy our life-- and I tell my friends, I always have something. I have a big calendar on my desk. And I always have something that I can look forward to, even if I have to make that date. If I look down and say, well, I think I'll plan on going to Las Vegas this month. If I have to create something to make that month special, I do it."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","host","Ira Glass","00:05:58.15"," The house itself is a mix of high-brow and low-brow-- incredibly elegant rooms with beautiful furniture and expensive paintings, and here and there, paintings of doe-eyed girls, picked up at sidewalk art sales. The little embroidered pillows that say things like, ""Murder, yes. Divorce, never"" And ""Screw the golden years, there's a safari room."" In short, it's hard to imagine Bill Clinton living here. But it's a place that his mother-- Virginia Kelley-- would probably just love."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","host","Ira Glass","00:06:36.02","It is impossible to imagine an American building a house today as a duplicate of the White House as a way to lure the president over. People just do not view the presidency with the same respect as they did back in George Hearst's day. Witness Rosemary's response when I ask her this question about her home purchase."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:06:52.38"," Was the fact that it was, in part, a replica of the White House part of what drew you to it?"
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","subject","Rosemary Eckersley","00:06:57.71"," No, it wasn't. It really wasn't."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","host","Ira Glass","00:07:10.28"," The asking price for this Western White House is $8.5 million. It has 27,000 square feet, 22 rooms. Coldwell Banker real estate agents recently put together an estimate of what the real White House would sell for if it were ever put on the open market. The real White House, by the way, has 43,000 square feet and 132 rooms. It sits on 18 acres of prime downtown real estate."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","2","Act Two. Television Man","host","Ira Glass","00:07:34.93","Estimate? $64 million. Actually, to qualify for the mortgage, you'd have to be able to make monthly payments $600,000 a month. $64 million. Of course, according to the FEC, candidates Clinton and Dole each spent far more than that for the privilege of just living in the place for four years."

"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","host","Ira Glass","00:08:43.25","Michael Lewis has said in the past that one of the reasons for the dullness and mendacity in modern campaigns is that American politicians still have not adjusted to the presence of television cameras. He got a chance to see the effect of television cameras firsthand on the political process just last month when he momentarily left the unglamorous life of a print reporter for another higher calling."

"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","host","Michael Lewis","00:10:14.64","When I step onto the plane, a second Dole staffer tells me the same thing. As I take my seat across the coffee table from a radio lady, a third Dole worker stops by and stresses the point. Apparently, the place where the campaign television journalist spends the vast majority of his time is considered outside the bounds of television journalism."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","host","Michael Lewis","00:10:41.86","Before all these warnings, it had never occurred to me to film on the Dole plane. Now it does. Just before takeoff, I stand up and take my first shot. A fat cameraman on his way to the toilet squeezes past a skinny stewardess, and I have him in my crosshairs. ""You're not supposed to do that!"" a voice shrieks out at me. It's the radio lady playing narc. Charlie appears beside my seat to remind me of ""the rule."" He does a nice job of not being upset."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","host","Michael Lewis","00:11:24.35","The day unfolds uneventfully-- Dole gives a speech in a gym-- except for my peculiar new relationship with the Dole campaign staff. Normally, I have to set off a flare to get their attention. Today, Charlie takes the seat beside me on the bus and for the rest of the day never seems to be very far away. Whatever they think I might do, I don't. By the time the rally starts, I have busted the sound mechanism, lost the earplugs, and run out of batteries. I put the camera to one side. Charlie vanishes."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","host","Michael Lewis","00:11:56.61","But then we head back to the plane and a fresh battery, which brings us to the episode of the shrimp."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","host","Michael Lewis","00:12:16.13","Once we'd settled into our seats, I set about trying to fix all the parts of the camera I'd busted. In order not to offend the Dole people, I decide to test the thing on what I figure is a declassified object-- a large plate of cold, mottled shrimp that has been laid on the table between me and a pair of radio reporters."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","host","Michael Lewis","00:12:36.19","I hunker right over the little buggers so that the ABC technicians will see I have absorbed what they've taught me about not giving in to the temptation of zoom. But the moment I'm in place, the radio woman shrieks out to the Dole staff and makes to cover the shrimp with a sheet of paper. ""It's OK,"" I say gently. ""I'm just seeing if this thing still works."" I keep shooting for a good five seconds. Then I put the camera away."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","host","Michael Lewis","00:13:06.12","Suddenly, a Dole lady is in my face, teeth gritted, breath blowing. ""We told you seven times not to film on the plane,"" she shouts. ""You don't know how serious this is."""
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","host","Michael Lewis","00:13:18.08","""But it was just the shrimp,"" I begin to say before she cuts me off. ""We told you.""

One moment, they are an undifferentiated jumble of people shivering in the cold. The next, they are the ardent supporters of Nader and Perot, pro-life and anti-vivisection, anti-deficit and pro-welfare. Of course, the SteadyShot is not permitted inside the Bushnell Theatre. It is too powerful a weapon to be permitted close to the candidates."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","host","Michael Lewis","00:14:51.82","So after a brief altercation with a security guard, I retire to Spin Alley. Spin Alley is what the debate organizers have renamed the Hartford Civic Center until a few journalists start pointing out that only a few years ago, political hacks actually denied that they ""spun"" at all. The signs saying Spin Alley are then ripped down, which, when you think about it, is itself a form of spin."

When she enters the frame, the comely Maureen Dowd dives behind her notepad, and who can blame her? Once you're in the camera's eye, you no longer have control of your soul.

"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","host","Ira Glass","00:17:42.64","This section of our program on television continues. We have this argument about TV and politics from Henry Jenkins, director of film and media studies at MIT."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","subject","Henry Jenkins","00:17:50.93"," I think what we're dealing with is a kind of crucial transitional moment in American politics. And it's actually change that's occurred over the last couple of elections from an era where network television dominated the political campaign toward a point where cable television is dominating the campaign and looking toward a point when cyberspace or the online communities will dominate. Each of those medium have different properties which candidates have to respond to and shape their campaigns around."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","subject","Henry Jenkins","00:18:20.16","So if we go back eight years to Bush versus Dukakis, Bush was a paramount politician of an era of network television. Network is based on a broadcast model. That is, it speaks the same message to multiple publics. There's not a lot of targeting to regional-specific audiences or narrow demographic groups."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","subject","Henry Jenkins","00:18:40.93","The strategy that Bush adapted in that campaign is what he called ""Story of the Day."" ""Story of the Day"" is you pick a topic that you want to hit your opponent on especially, and you find ways to dramatize that topic through images, through your personal appearances, through the other people who are tied to the campaign who are giving talking points. And you want one unified message which carries the day."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","subject","Henry Jenkins","00:19:04.35","Classic example is Bush goes to Boston Harbor to attack to Dukakis on his environmental record. All three major news networks gave that top coverage that evening. And what you find is that news cameras use the same soundbites by Bush, they use the same images, the cameras actually do Bush's dirty work by focusing directly on the sewage waste in the Boston Harbor and dramatizing his issues. And Dukakis' response is simply him talking to the camera. So that's the politics of the network era."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","subject","Henry Jenkins","00:19:33.62","Four years pass, and the way America watches television changes fairly drastically over that period of time. More and more people are getting their news and information from cable. There's a wider array of options. And cable is embracing this narrowcasting notion of specific appeals to specific demographic groups, of targeted messages, of a focused public. And Clinton recognizes that there are all kinds of opportunities in cable that were not there in the network broadcast paradigm."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","subject","Henry Jenkins","00:20:03.35","So Clinton uses cable to completely blindside Bush. He goes on MTV. He goes on Arsenio Hall. He goes on Larry King. He goes on Nashville Network. He's courting a number of different publics with different messages that are tailored very intensely to the interest of that particular group. What appears on network TV is simply an image of that appearance-- Clinton answering questions about his underwear on MTV or Clinton playing the saxophone on Arsenio Hall, often images that trivialize those appearances. But for the constituencies that Clinton is speaking to, such as the MTV audience, he's given an enormous amount of space to frame his issues and his terms to that specific voting block."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","subject","Henry Jenkins","00:20:43.23","So what we get is a diffused message from Clinton during that campaign, which motivates voters. So the largest voter participation of 18- to 27-year-olds of any election in recent memory-- since the 18-year-olds got the right to vote, in fact-- motivated by Clinton's appearance on MTV. And Rock the Vote was really pivotal in bringing out that election."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:21:03.66"," And so what have you seen this year in the '96 campaign? How has this developed this year?"
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","subject","Henry Jenkins","00:21:08.46"," Well, Clinton, I think, learned a brutalizing message, which is that you run on cable right now but you have to govern on network TV. That is, all those diffused messages to multiple publics, which developed intense voter participation four years ago, became scattershot, confused, decentered unfocused when he tried to govern because he was still being evaluated on those three major networks on the evening news. And in that space, Clinton's administration seemed completely incompetent. So Clinton had to retool himself for the evening news."

"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","subject","Henry Jenkins","00:22:13.56","Gingrich recognized that that was free air time on C-SPAN every evening in the dinner hour. He went on every night at the same time, the same focused speech on every issue of the day, and said flamboyant things that had a very intense appeal to conservative Americans. He graduated from that to The Family Network and to GOP TV, which are even more focused on the conservative constituencies. And he was able to spring from free air time on C-SPAN to a national political constituency."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","subject","Henry Jenkins","00:22:40.64","The minute he reaches power, though, he's also being judged by the evening news where those red meat issues that he focused, that got attention on C-SPAN, suddenly seem too intense or too conservative or too reactionary and extreme for middle America. And so he also failed to be able to govern on network television. So we're seeing is that politicians are being pulled back and forth between the network paradigm of a general message to a general audience and the cable space which opens up a lot of chances for challengers to emerge and to begin to exploit the medium to get messages out and motivate very intensely committed groups of voters."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:23:16.50"," Have you seen either candidate actually use the cable strategy in this election?"
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","subject","Henry Jenkins","00:23:21.50"," I think Clinton still uses it, but I don't think either of them are using it as effectively as Clinton did four years ago. I think they are frightened by it. Dole is fairly inept at every medium I can think of. There's not a single medium one could say Bob Dole uses well. We've seen him completely misunderstand the nature of this cable politics in the last debate, where he's used to talking on network news, where he talks over the interviewer and delivers his message no matter what."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","subject","Henry Jenkins","00:23:47.28","That very first question in the debate when the school teacher asked him about children's innocence and their hopes for the future, and he used it in cynically as a platform to attack Bill Clinton on his ethics issue. One saw an example where he didn't understand the embodiment of those issues in specific people and specific constituencies and how it matters who you're speaking to and where you're speaking in cable."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","host","Ira Glass","00:24:09.78"," I asked Henry Jenkins if he wasn't overstating his thesis a little, especially when it came to Bill Clinton. I wondered if Bill Clinton didn't know more about handling the network news when he took office than Jenkins gives him credit for. After all, in 1992, Bill Clinton made four or five cable appearances during the campaign. But he wasn't just running on cable. Every day of the campaign, there were staged events for the network news and there was the Clinton message of the day."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","3","Act Three. Losers","subject","Henry Jenkins","00:24:32.08"," But those are moments that are probably the most memorable moments in the campaign. They are moments they were replayed over and over on those networks. They are moments that I think shaped public perceptions of these candidates in a significant way. And I think our understanding of Clinton was defined more through those moments than through the evening news. So their impact is much greater than the sheer number of events."

They are a militant self-deportation movement encouraging all minorities to leave the United States. That's right, all minorities. Its founder, Daniel D. Portado, has appeared on Spanish-language TV. I actually saw a video of one of these appearances where basically, the entire Latino studio audience yelled at him nonstop for his entire appearance."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","4","Act Four.

Prop 187 was the proposition that cut off social services to illegal immigrants. He thought these Mexican-Americans-- who were in favor of cutting off those services-- had the right idea but just did not go far enough. They just didn't take it to its logical conclusion, and he felt that self-deportation was the only real solution."

And before I could get a word out, McCain says, 'I owe you an apology.'"""

""Basically, someone had handed him a script,"" says Ifshin, ""and he read it. He was sorry he did it, and said he wouldn't do that kind of thing again. Then he asked me to stop by his office, which I did, and normally wouldn't do. It was blind fate, I told him at that time. I said, 'I owed you an apology, and you robbed me of the chance to make it.' And he was characteristically modest and humble about it."" Later that year, McCain and Ifshin, together with a Vietnamese emigre named Doan Van Toai, established the Institute for Democracy in Vietnam."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","5","Act 4","host","Michael Lewis","00:53:54.84","Ifshin shifts painfully in his chair and stops to catch his breath. It was at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial that what he calls ""the second half of the story"" with McCain began. On Memorial Day of 1993, Bill Clinton spoke at the site. Both McCain and Ifshin were present. Clinton was cheered loudly. He was also heckled. And one of the hecklers waved a sign that said ""tell us about Ifshin."""
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","5","Act 4","host","Michael Lewis","00:54:22.97","Four weeks later, Ifshin found himself on a flight to Washington with McCain, who motioned for him to take the seat beside him. Ifshin says, ""He asked why I hadn't taken a job in the administration. I said this and that. We played 20 questions until finally he said, 'It's because of that stupid sign, isn't it?' And I said, ""Yes, partly it was.' And he said, 'Come to my office tomorrow morning and we'll settle this thing once and for all.'"""

'Tell us about Ifshin,' it read. My other purpose in speaking today is to do just that. I want to talk about David Ifshin. David Ifshin is my friend. This declaration may come as a shock to those people whose perception of David--"""
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","5","Act 4","host","Ira Glass","00:56:00.20"," Well, in the weeks after that was published-- it was published in May, by the way, not written in May-- David Ifshin died, and John McCain became a leading vice presidential contender after Jack Kemp. It was John McCain who nominated Bob Dole, gave the speech for that at the Republican National Convention. And Michael Lewis ran into McCain on Election Day."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","5","Act 4","subject","Michael Lewis","00:56:19.22"," It was funny. Everywhere you went with the Dole campaign, senators and governors would come out of the woodwork because they wanted to have their picture taken and show support, all the rest. Until the final day, and they all cleared out. No senators or governors were traveling with him. There was one person at his side, and it was John McCain."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","5","Act 4","subject","Michael Lewis","00:56:37.66","And I was in Russell, Kansas when the Dole campaign came through. And I noticed this. I saw McCain kind of off to one side. He had been with Dole all day. And I went up to talk to him. And he said to me almost apologetically, he said, ""You know I wouldn't be here if I thought he was going to win."""
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","5","Act 4","subject","Michael Lewis","00:56:56.01","And I knew that. He was there because he knew that it was Dole's time of need, and it was time for someone to step up. And this is what's so curious about McCain. I think that he continually-- as I covered this campaign-- I was new to politics when I came into this campaign. I had never written about politics. I found that McCain sort restored my faith in the process again and again."
"41","Politics","1996-11-08","5","Act 4","subject","Michael Lewis","00:57:21.14","There was something about his-- how should I put it? It was his willingness to stick his neck out for a losing or an unpopular cause that was so different from most of the people who do what he does for a living-- so different from the ordinary political attitude-- that was refreshing and inspiring."
