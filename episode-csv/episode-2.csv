"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:01.73","OK, three boys, aged 13, 15, and 16. All three chose to appear with fake names on this radio program. And the fake names they chose, you ready? K-Rad, Mr. Warez, and Fred. Those first two names come from the world of computer hacking and software piracy. Mr. Warez, for example, that's ""warez,"" as in ""wares,"" as in ""softwares,"" as in pirated softwares, illegal softwares. And as for Fred--"
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Fred","00:00:40.44","Why Fred? For no reason, man. There's got to be someone else named Fred out there."

"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:39.86","This was kind of an unpleasant McDonald's. Because it was in Times Square, they decided to have neon lights everywhere in this place. A crush of sweaty people at the counter, tourists, most of us. It was the middle of summer. Fred took charge."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Fred","00:01:55.78","What do you guys want?"
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","K-rad","00:01:57.88","I want a number one meal."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Fred","00:01:59.70","OK, I'm paying for this. You're paying for my cab, OK? Whatever I can pay for. OK, we'll have a number one meal."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:06.31","They're actually in Manhattan for a computer hackers' convention this summer, and Fred was not used to the downtown prices."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Fred","00:02:12.75","Oh my god. It's $5, man. You guys are chipping in. I can't pay for this."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:18.21","I think it's fair to say that one sign that your criminal career is not going so well is if you have to worry about the prices at McDonald's. But K-Rad, Mr. Warez, and Fred were involved in very low-level types of crimes. All of them involve computers. They pirated software. They scammed free CD-ROM games. They cheated one of the big online computer services out of a few hundred dollars in online time."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:43.97","All in all, they didn't steal very much. And they didn't steal very effectively. But they did try to steal. Take this phone scam, where they would call people at random and try to get a calling card number or a credit card number out of them."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","K-rad","00:02:58.25","Basically, the way it works is this. You call up somebody. You say, ""This is the AT&T operator. I have a priority collect call for--"" so-and-so's name. And the whole point is you have to sound like you're not calling somebody up with the intention of getting them. You have to sound like you've been sitting in this chair for 10 hours, and you want to go home."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","K-rad","00:03:17.65","So you got to go, ""This is the AT&T operator. I have a collect call for Paul. Will you accept charges, sir?"" ""Uh, yeah. I'll accept charges."" ""All right, hold on one second."""
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","K-rad","00:03:25.35","Then you tap on the keyboard. You say, ""I'm sorry. You seem to have a restriction on your phone line. You can't accept collect calls to this line."" And then they yell, and they go, ""What do you mean, I can't accept collect calls to my line? I've been getting collect calls to this line for 20 years."""
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","K-rad","00:03:37.79","And then, you've got to go, ""Sir, there's nothing I can do about it. My computer says you can't receive a collect call on this line. Would you like to try an alternate billing method?"" In which case they will proceed to either give you a calling card or a major credit card."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:03:48.42","And that, of course, is the idea behind the whole thing, to end up with a calling card number or a credit card number that is not your own, that you can use yourself. Now I should say that before you go out and try this yourselves, if you are thinking about doing this yourself right now, I should tell you one important fact. It doesn't work."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","K-rad","00:04:06.24","The reason it doesn't work is because a good percentage of people, after the point at which they go through the mind-boggling experience of not understanding what it means to have a restriction on your line, because nobody knows what that means, then they'll just say, ""Oh, this is too much trouble. Forget it. I won't accept the collect call."""
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:04:22.00","The other scams these guys run don't do much better. They tried to hack their way into the mainframe system of a big computer retailer. But they were caught and stopped before they got very far. They are such unaccomplished computer hackers that Fred himself was actually the victim of computer hackers twice. Someone broke into Fred's account on one computer bulletin board and used his account and his electronic mail to visit some of the nether regions of the net."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Fred","00:04:48.44","Remember, you talked to the guy on IRC. There's this weird guy. This guy was going on all these sex channels. And he was wrecking my name and stuff. It was awful."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","K-rad","00:04:57.73","You can't get pissed at him. I wouldn't get pissed at him, because that would be entirely hypocritical. I've said that if anybody ever steals one of my credit cards or ever hacks into my account or computer system, I will not care. And I will be perfectly allowable to that."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","K-rad","00:05:12.82","To go and say, ""I can't believe it. Somebody took my credit card."" Well, so what if I did it to everyone else? I'm perfectly willing to let someone do that to me."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:05:21.08","Over the summer was when they really started to get serious about using other people's credit cards, which they call ""carding."" They met a guy who was good at this and who taught them some tricks. K-Rad and Fred ordered $1,600 in computer merchandise on someone else's credit card. They had it delivered to a neutral address. They picked it up. They sold half of it for cash."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:05:44.46","And one thing that's peculiar about this story is that these are rich kids. K-Rad and Fred live in a wealthy upstate community. They attend what is one of the most expensive, prestigious private schools in the country. But they steal."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:06:00.94","Fred believes that he has no choice. He really suffers over money. He's this skinny, young-looking 15-year-old. And he is perpetually strapped for cash. And he said that his parents couldn't help him much with money right now because they had just gone $500,000 into debt."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Fred","00:06:24.29","Because they bought a house right before the depression and stuff. The recession, excuse me. I consider it a depression. I've noticed the effects."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:06:35.52","At one point, to get some cash, he actually sold the computer that his parents had bought for him. And I don't think they knew. His idea is that he wanted to replace the computer as quickly as he could with the help of a stranger's credit card."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:06:53.15","And he also wanted to get all the other things that the other kids at his expensive private school had. He wanted to have a microwave. He wanted to have a stereo. Basically, he just wanted to be like everybody else."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Fred","00:07:04.61","I'm also pretty good at shoplifting. But my whole thing on that is that I will not steal anything if I have the money for it. And a lot of times, like the store at my school, like the grill, I steal from that a lot. But I also give them $10 for no reason if I have the money because I feel bad about what I've stolen. And if I ever get the money so I don't have to do this shit anymore, then I'm not going to do it."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:07:25.30","What's striking about this is how these boys want to convince themselves-- I think they really do-- want to convince themselves that they are good, and that what they do does not harm anyone. And if it does harm someone, there's always the reassuring thought that they keep very near at hand that someday they can make it up to the injured party."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","K-rad","00:07:45.77","As noble as this sounds, this is one thing that I absolutely guarantee that sounds like the biggest load of crap anyone could ever say. But if I am ever in a financial--"
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Mr. Warez","00:07:54.86","We believe in you."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","K-rad","00:07:56.08","No, no one should believe in me. This is the biggest ""I'm really good inside."" If I ever find myself-- and I've made this vow to myself-- in a good enough financial situation, I will repay everything I have ever done now. If I find myself making $2 million a year, I will send a $10,000 check to the company which I stole calling cards from. That is something I definitely want to do if I am in the financial situation to do it."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:08:19.52","K-Rad told me that the $1,600 that they charged to a stranger's Visa card was, in fact, a victimless crime, that the card owner would call Visa, have the charge removed from his bill. And that Visa figures a certain amount of fraud is just the cost of doing business."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","K-rad","00:08:34.48","One thing that I've always said in all my doings is that I will never, ever do something that will severely hurt an individual person. OK? So for example, if it involves-- I would never mug someone. I would never beat someone up for money. I'd never shoplift. Well, maybe I-- no, I wouldn't shoplift."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:08:51.33","That's one of my favorite parts of the interview. Hold on. I'm just going to play that tape back. Because you can actually hear him-- he's struggling so much, you can actually hear him working it out out loud. Hold on, I'm just going to rewind for a second."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:09:02.81","[TAPE REWINDING]"
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","K-rad","00:09:07.23","--never beat someone up for money. I'd never shoplift. Well, maybe I-- no, I wouldn't shoplift. Because that is hurting the individual person."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:09:15.68","See what I mean? So we headed out of the McDonald's and back to the hotel where the computer hackers' convention was taking place. On the way, without any prompting at all, Fred elaborated on the idea that he was only stealing because he absolutely had to."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Fred","00:09:32.44","I go to boarding school. And I don't have that much-- I don't have any money or anything. And I get really hungry and stuff. I have a fast metabolism. And seriously, I starve. And I lost 10 pounds in one week. And that's not good for someone who's really skinny, like I am. And then a lot of it is just stuff I want, you know?"
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Fred","00:09:54.90","And yeah, I just really want to stress that in other ways, we're not bad people. And we don't go around trying to screw all people in any way we can. Because we're not at all."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Fred","00:10:06.51","I mean, I do social work. I tutored kids. I do a lot of stuff which isn't necessarily evil and more good. But sometimes, it's just like, I don't know, man. I like doing it. I can't explain it."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:10:24.62","Talk about that part of it. What is the thrill of doing it?"
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Fred","00:10:27.99",""
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:10:56.53","By this point, we were back in the hotel lobby. We took the elevators up to the floor where the hackers' convention was taking place. K-Rad said that real hackers do not use their skills like this. They do not use their skills for personal gain. They don't do carding. They don't steal."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:11:13.54","The whole idea of computer hacking, for these guys anyway, is that it's a kind of pure, zen pursuit. It's an ends in itself. You break into the computer for its own sake and to look around, and for the knowledge of everyone, especially you."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:11:28.74","We stood in the hallway. People streamed by. We tried to move to a corner where we would not be overheard. And K-Rad said, actually, that they had never really talked about their illegal activities this much before with anyone."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","K-rad","00:11:43.75","The most thing I'm worried about is I'm actually starting, for the first time, to say this all out loud, everything I've done. And suddenly, it doesn't sound as hacker, much, anymore. And I've known that ever since I moved into doing maybe some credit card thing. And that's why I'm, in fact, even considering giving up on doing all the carding and stuff like that, which seriously, I am."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:12:02.46","Fred then shot him this look. Because if K-Rad were serious, and they did stop carding, Fred would not be able to get a computer to replace the old one that his parents gave him."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Fred","00:12:13.34","What about my computer?"
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","K-rad","00:12:14.75","What?"
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Mr. Warez","00:12:15.22","Your computer will come first."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Fred","00:12:16.45","Jesus Christ, man. I want to get a gun and shoot you."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","K-rad","00:12:21.30","All right, after your computer."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:12:22.73","The thing about a bad conscience is that it splits you in half. And Fred said that he had two different modes. That was the word he used, ""modes."" He said that sometimes he would think about what they were doing. And he knew it was wrong, and it would bother him. But mostly, he tried not to think about it."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Fred","00:12:41.93","My worst fear is that I can end up going to hell for doing this. And that's my worst fear."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:12:46.27","Do you believe in hell?"
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Fred","00:12:47.92","Yeah, I do."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:12:50.46","And you think you can go to hell for getting a computer on somebody else's credit card?"
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Fred","00:12:54.63","I don't know. I hope not. I really hope not. It's always been my biggest fear. That's why I'm afraid of dying. I'm afraid if there's something I've done which just is like the straw on the camel's back, that's going to be what's going to do it."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:13:07.86","How big is this worry? Will this keep you up at night?"
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","subject","Fred","00:13:11.25","Yeah, maybe for a couple minutes. And then I just sort of put it out of my mind, you know?"
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:13:16.35","His share of the carding profits was $800. I told him that from an adult's perspective, this did not seem like a lot of money. I didn't think you could do eternity in hell for $800."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:13:30.19","And as soon as I said this, I really regretted it. Fred's body language changed completely. It was like I was calling him a little kid. It was like saying that he was ridiculous to worry over something so small. It was just one of these moments. He got quieter, and he kind of pulled into himself a little bit."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:13:48.50","Then Mr. Warez spoke up. He said that sure, maybe by adult standards, this wasn't much money. But to them, it was a lot, that it was plenty enough to count."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:14:00.68","When is hell a possibility? Whenever you think it is, it is. More on this when our program continues."

Dying smiling but confused, not comprehending how her pelvis could be so simultaneously rigid and relaxed, rigid then relaxed, like that thing my father told me not to do.

""Liberating"" meaning make it so that you don't need quarters for that pay phone. You just pick up and dial like a regular house phone. So that way, we could make an endless amount of phone calls without putting quarters."
"2","Small Scale Sin","1995-11-24","4","Act Three","subject","Eli","00:43:11.79","Next step was to get into the network, find a session that was already going, and then knock them off while they were connected, and then sit there, watching them.
