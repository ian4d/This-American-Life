"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","1","Act One. Anti-oedipus","host","Ira Glass","00:00:12.54"," What could be more horrible than the moment when you realize that everybody in the world can see some aspect of you, something about you, that you never even knew that you were revealing, that you didn't want to reveal? So Mubarak was at a track meet-- this is back in high school-- he was at this track meet, and he was setting up those runners' blocks you use in track."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","1","Act One. Anti-oedipus","subject","Mubarak","00:00:34.66"," And I was sort of pampering my blocks, moving the blocks back and forth ever so slightly, hair lengths, testing out how they felt and standing up and putting my hands on my hip and putting my finger on my cheek and looking at it as if I was in deep thought. And bending down and probably even dusting off the blocks."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","1","Act One. Anti-oedipus","subject","Mubarak","00:01:00.19","What I didn't know at the time was there was the whole group of track members from the opposing team who were standing, watching me, and laughing. They were like, this big sissy is what they're putting up for us to beat?"
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","1","Act One. Anti-oedipus","host","Ira Glass","00:01:22.08"," Remember, please, high school. High school, where, in the hierarchy of put downs, the worst thing you could call a boy was ""sissy."" Mubarak won his match."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","1","Act One. Anti-oedipus","subject","Mubarak","00:01:35.66"," And the coach came up after I won, and he actually gave me this big hug. And he was like, ""That was great."" And I was like, ""Thanks."" But my time wasn't anything particularly better than before. So I kind of had this puzzled look in his face. And he's like, ""That was great the way you psyched those guys out by acting like a big sissy in front of your blocks and then showing them."" And as soon as he said that, it hit me, what had happened. And I was like-- I played along. ""Yeah, hey, good thing I thought of that."""

"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Ira Glass","00:02:55.02"," Act One. Well, the tragedy of the story of Oedipus, if you remember this from school, is that a son kills his father and marries his mother and then, of course, rips out his eyes when he realizes what it is that he's done. And the thing about this story is that he does all these things unwittingly. He doesn't know that that's what he's doing with his mother and father when he does it."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Ira Glass","00:03:20.95","Well, the first story on today's program is also about a family that ends up getting ripped apart. It's also about a family where the son ends up with the mother, the father gone. And it's also a story where the tragedy of it is that it all happens without any of them really wanting it to happen this way. It's the ending they all wanted to avoid. Nancy Updike prepared this story of an American family and of what it means to be a man."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:03:46.73"," This story is like one those Russian dolls where there's always a smaller one inside. The smallest doll, the core of the drama, is the fact that Mubarak, a childhood sissy, grew up to be a different kind of sissy than his father. His father is nerdy and bookish. Mubarak's gay."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:04:06.42","Everything around that core gets bigger and bigger until finally you can't believe the biggest and the smallest have anything to do with each other, the one is so bloated and the other so tiny."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:04:17.51","At the beginning of this story, Mubarak's parents are married and in love, and both prepared to live far from everything they know to be with each other. At the end of the story, they may still be in love, but they're divorced and an ocean apart and not speaking. And Mubarak is caring for his mother the way a husband might."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:04:37.33"," OK, Margie Ruth."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Margie","00:04:38.44"," Now, don't get it too hot."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:04:40.10"," I'm not going to get it too hot."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:04:41.46"," Mubarak starts Margie's shower, and he's holding on to her so she won't fall. And she's holding on to him too. She's about five feet tall, naked, and fragile looking, and very pale. He's dressed in jeans and a shirt that he knows are about to get really wet."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:04:58.83"," All right, lift your breasts. Lift one at a time so I can wash under it."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","interviewer","Nancy Updike","00:05:03.98"," Hey, Margie, was it hard the first time Mubarak gave you a shower?"
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Margie","00:05:08.37"," I got embarrassed."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","interviewer","Nancy Updike","00:05:13.47"," How did you get over being embarrassed?"
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Margie","00:05:15.92"," I don't know. Just because it happens over and and over again. Mubarak is my son, you know?"
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:05:22.38"," He gets a washcloth in under her breasts, and she stands serenely, blinking in the water. It's a moment so intimate it's hard to watch. But then, as he gets her out of the shower and is drying her off, there's another moment that makes the intimacy of everything before it seem completely beside the point and prettied up in comparison. He takes a baby wipe and wipes her butt for her."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Margie","00:05:44.51"," Nobody's going to give me a shot today, are they?"
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:05:46.69"," No, we have to take some blood, though. We have to go to the lab, and they're going to take some blood."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Margie","00:05:51.73"," Well, that's a shot."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:05:52.46"," It's not a shot. They're drawing blood."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Margie","00:05:54.23"," They put--"
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:05:56.28"," They stick you, but they're not giving you a shot. They're taking blood. There's a difference."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Margie","00:06:02.14"," You ever tried it?"
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:06:04.94"," Margie's only 66, but in the last couple of years, she's had a heart attack and two small strokes, which paralyzed her right arm and affected her memory. It cuts in and out like faulty wiring. Sometimes she's talkative and remembers a lot. Sometimes she's not and she doesn't."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:06:21.42"," Hey, you know what? Lift your breast for me again so that we can make sure. You don't have a rash under there anymore, do you?"
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Margie","00:06:25.91"," I don't think so."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:06:27.10"," Because we've got to make sure it stays dry so it doesn't get a rash under there."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","interviewer","Nancy Updike","00:06:31.97"," Mubarak, is this closer than you ever thought you'd get to an adult woman's body?"
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:06:36.74"," [LAUGHS] You could say that."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:06:39.84"," But this is the end of the story. This is today. Let's go back to the beginning. Mubarak's family didn't really notice that he was, as he tells it, a big sissy, because they were all oddballs. No matter where they were living, at least one of them was always not quite fitting in."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:06:57.34","Margie's from Georgia and lived most of her married life either up north or in the Middle East. Mubarak's father, Sabir, is Palestinian, born in Jordan. But for most of the marriage, they all lived in a small town in Pennsylvania where he was a professor of civil engineering. Now if Mubarak was a sissy in white, working-class, Catholic Hershey, PA, Sabir was too."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:07:19.63"," We got a week off of school every year because so many people, so many boys, went deer hunting. And of course, I didn't go hunting, and I didn't play football. And I didn't do all of those things that the boys in the neighborhood were supposed to do, especially hunting. Hunting was like a yardstick of when you reached manhood."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:07:49.47"," Sabir, meanwhile, to Mubarak's shame and horror, had to call on neighborhood dads to do simple mechanical tasks like unclogging a drain. And Margie was the one who hung their wedding pictures because Sabir claimed he didn't know how to hammer a nail."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:08:04.01"," No, Sabir didn't do any of that stuff. Sabir was always very formal. He always had a sport jacket. I remember cutting grass was a big deal out there, like lawn care, how green and how even and how perfect was your yard. And I remember Sabir was in the yard cutting the grass. And he was cutting the grass, and he had a sport coat and a tie on, which is funny if you think about it."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","interviewer","Nancy Updike","00:08:39.50"," Why would he do it?"
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:08:41.92"," I think that came from the Middle East idea that if you are educated, that there's a certain position that you have in society and that you should always look and act a certain way."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:09:00.39"," You can see why, in this atmosphere, Sabir at one point panicked and made Margie sign Mubarak up for Little League. To toughen him up, he told her. But mostly, Margie says, Sabir worshipped Mubarak. He adored him."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Margie","00:09:14.51"," Mubarak this and Mubarak that and Mubarak the other. Everything he talked about was Mubarak. After he found out Mubarak was gay, he hardly ever said-- wouldn't hardly even mention his name."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:09:31.77"," Margie was the one who made the phone call to Mubarak after finding a bunch of gay adult cards in his room. He was 20 years old and staying with friends in Germany at the time, on his way to a semester in England."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:09:43.17"," And it was the middle of the night. I don't remember if we were exactly in bed. And the mother came down and said in German to my friend, there's a phone call from America, and it's an emergency for your American friend. So I was all nervous, and I went upstairs. And it was Margie, and she was crying. She was hysterical. I said, ""Margie, what's wrong?"" And she said, ""You have to come home now."""
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:10:12.30","And I said, ""Why? What's wrong?"" And she just kept repeating, ""You have to come home now."" And I kept trying to get out of her what was wrong. So she finally said, ""We found a good hospital in Tennessee that can cure you."" And then I knew what was wrong. And of course I told her that I wasn't coming home until the end of the semester, and I would see her in January. And I think I hung up right away."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:10:42.00"," This was the beginning of their world starting to shift and become something else. Sabir blamed Margie for Mubarak being gay. Sabir, who never raised his voice before, would pound the table and say Mubarak was gay because he's a mama's boy."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Margie","00:10:57.18"," I didn't think I'd married the same person at those times. He used to be jolly and gay and cheerful and tell jokes. I didn't know him anymore. I guess he didn't know me either."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:11:17.42"," He was in such bad shape that he had taken off time from the university. I think he took a whole semester off from teaching at the university. He was so bad at one point, he would sit and stare into space and not respond to conversations and questions. And they had home health care-- an IV for him at home because he wouldn't eat."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:11:45.35"," When Mubarak came home around Christmas, they all sat down at the kitchen table for a family meeting."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:11:50.69"," Margie didn't say hardly anything the whole time. And neither did I, actually. Sabir did most of the talking. Basically, he started with, you're our son and we love you, but this is wrong, and this is an illness. I've looked into it, and there are doctors who say that if you just try, if you get help, that you can change."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","interviewer","Nancy Updike","00:12:18.89"," Did he say the word ""homosexual""?"
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:12:21.45"," Oh, god, no. He would never say that. He would say, ""your condition"" or ""your problem"" or ""your situation."" He would never say the word ""gay"" or ""homosexual"" ever, ever, ever. Even in the years after that, he never, ever said that word."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:12:38.98"," The biggest problem with Mubarak being gay was that he would never have children. He would never have a son to carry on the family name as Sabir had done and as Sabir's father had done. This was Mubarak's obligation. After a long argument, the last thing Sabir said to Mubarak was this."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:12:57.19"," I remember he looked at me and he said, ""I will sell all the land in Palestine to raise the money to send you to a doctor if you ever decide that you would go."" Being Palestinian and understanding how important land is, I mean, land is identity, it's a future, it's the past, it's everything. And for Sabir to say that he would sell all of his land showed that this was really the top priority in his whole life."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:13:41.28"," For two years, nothing changed. Mubarak stayed in school and kept being gay. Sabir stayed depressed and wrote Mubarak long letters saying he loved Mubarak but Mubarak was sick and he owed it to Sabir to get help. Margie quietly began flooding Mubarak's college mailbox with condoms."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:13:58.36","Then Margie and Sabir moved back to the Middle East as they'd always planned to do when Sabir retired. He was 65. She was 59. Six months later, everything shifted again. The family mutated again, becoming more like what it would soon be and less like it had been before. It started with another phone call to Mubarak."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:14:19.13"," Well, the way I first found out about it was I got a telephone call one afternoon from Margie. She said, ""Honey, do you think I could come live with you?"" And I didn't know what she was talking about. I said, ""Margie, what are you talking about?"" She said, ""Do you think I could come live with you?"" And then she told me that she and Sabir were getting divorced because he was going to marry another woman and have another son."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:14:59.68"," In fact, divorce wasn't even what Sabir wanted. At first, he asked Margie if she would be his partner in what he called--"
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Margie","00:15:06.03"," Joint venture. I want you to help me find a young lady you think you can get along with. I said, ""What?"""
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:15:14.92"," And he said, ""I want to marry another woman and have a baby."""
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Margie","00:15:22.02"," I said, ""OK, Sabir, you better find one you think you can get along with because I'm not going to be here."""
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:15:30.85"," And that was plan A, and the plan B was having another wife at a different apartment. And then plan C was him getting married in the West Bank, just going down there a couple weeks a year, and then basically living with Margie in Jordan. And her response to that was always my favorite. That's when she asked him-- she said, ""OK, that's fine as long as I can have a--"
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Margie","00:15:56.77"," Boyfriend. He said, ""Why?"" And I said, ""So when you ask me what I've been doing, I'll tell you the same thing you've been doing while you were over there."" He didn't appreciate that either."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:16:10.66"," And I remember Sabir wrote me a very, very long letter explaining what he was doing and why he was doing it and how he had been forced into doing this because for years he had been asking me to go get help, and I was just ignoring him. And he felt that since I was not going to have a son to carry on the family name, that the responsibility of making sure that the family name survived suddenly became his again. And this was the only way he could see to do it. And he was very heavy on the, ""This is your fault. You're doing this to Margie, not me."""
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:16:58.79","The other thing that was really strange was he spent pages saying, ""Your mother is being very close-minded about all of this. Try to help me convince her to stay here. She doesn't have to leave. I don't want her to leave."""
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:17:20.16"," So Sabir divorced Margie, telling her every day until she left that he loved her and didn't want her to leave. And she got on the plane and began the life she's pretty much living now. From that point on, instead of a husband, she would have a son. And from the moment the plane touched down, he treated her the way you'd want your husband to treat you."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Margie","00:17:40.63"," I'll never forget when I came back, getting off plane. We got through customs and all that stuff. I saw this great big bunch of flowers somebody was holding way up in the air. Beautiful, beautiful bunch of flowers. And I said, somebody is certainly going to get themselves a beautiful bouquet of flowers. And guess who that was."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:18:02.84"," Well, any guesses? Margie moved into Mubarak's graduate school apartment, which, by the way, was at the same university where Sabir had taught. In her old life, she'd been supported by one man, her husband, the professor. In her new life, she was surrounded by a whole sissy entourage. Mubarak's friends were always coming in and whisking her away to the orchestra, to plays. They adored her."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:18:31.58","She still cried every day, many times a day, for the first few months. And every day, she got at least one letter from Sabir, sometimes two. Finally one day, the letter that came from Sabir said he'd gotten married. Mubarak, not knowing what was in the letter, gave it to Margie and went to his room."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:18:50.06"," We came back out. It was five or 10 minutes later. And she was still sitting there, but she had a funny look on her face. So I said, ""Are you OK?"" And she started saying things like, ""Please don't hurt me, please don't hurt me"" and crying. I'm like, ""Margie, what are you talking about?"""
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:19:10.09","""Don't come any closer. Don't come any closer. Don't hurt me."" And she didn't know who I was. She didn't know who she was."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Margie","00:19:19.01"," I was just out of it."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:19:20.43"," Her amnesia-- Mubarak calls it a vacation from the bad news-- lasted several days."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Mubarak","00:19:26.61"," One, two, three."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Cardiologist","00:19:28.88"," There you go."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","host","Nancy Updike","00:19:30.94"," We're in Margie's cardiologist's office, and she's about to surprise me. On the last day I spend with Margie and Mubarak, she suddenly murmurs that she wishes Mubarak had gotten married."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","2","Act Two. Instructions For Sissies","subject","Margie","00:19:40.73"," I wish you would've married."

Because suddenly, they didn't think I looked like what they meant by a faggot anymore, which is someone who's really pathetic and weak, because I also looked kind of tough and strange. And yet, there were these androgynous elements. And the result is that they just started leaving me alone. I didn't get called a faggot anymore in the hallway. I didn't really get called anything.

And it wasn't until college or a little after that I realized the real challenge was to be able to simply go out there like a drag queen does, without any of those balancing affectations of masculinity or toughness.

He displayed more courage when he walked into St. Greg's every morning than I've ever displayed in my life, which is why I had such a crush on him, I think. Of all the tough kids at St. Greg's, he was absolutely the toughest."

If I see him at night, I think it's really fun, and if I see the person during the day, I'm wondering, well, does he have a job? And what do people at work think? Being a member of a minority group, a racial minority, I think that it's really-- I'm just one who are a lot more conservative, and I think that when you label yourself, you make it a lot more difficult."

"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","5","Act 4","subject","Robert","00:53:40.86"," Yeah."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","5","Act 4","interviewer","Dan Savage","00:53:42.48"," Do you think that that being picked on had any impact on your adult choices around being very, very private?"
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","5","Act 4","subject","Robert","00:53:50.99"," Yes, I do. I do. You want to stay inside of the box.

"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","5","Act 4","interviewer","Dan Savage","00:54:10.71"," So part of what keeps you inside that realm of acceptable behavior, then, is fear of being picked on or being--"

"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","5","Act 4","interviewer","Dan Savage","00:54:17.53"," Labeled or a victim of anti-gay violence. But it's fear, then, at least partially."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","5","Act 4","subject","Robert","00:54:22.32"," Yeah."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","5","Act 4","interviewer","Dan Savage","00:54:23.56"," So in a way, when you see someone really swishy on the street, isn't that brave of them?"
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","5","Act 4","subject","Robert","00:54:31.34"," Not always. It depends on where the person's coming from. I don't think that if you're swishy and you happen to be in a ghetto of other gay men, then you're free to do that. But I don't think that you're exceptionally brave. I just think that you live in a very violent world, and things happen. And you try not to put yourself into a situation that bad things can happen to you."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","5","Act 4","host","Dan Savage","00:55:03.51"," I don't agree with Robert. The way I see it, the bravest of all the guys I talked to was Mark, the guy who described himself as feminine in his personal ad. Mark and that brave swishy senior I had a crush on at St. Greg's, they both have the courage to present their real selves to the world in all their glorious sissiness, which, in a world that despises feminine men and boys, is a risky thing to do, a brave thing to do."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","5","Act 4","host","Dan Savage","00:55:28.40","Now, contrast their behavior with that of men who are straight-acting, 100% discreet, and in the closet, or men who are constantly policing their own behavior. These are men ruled by fear-- fear of discovery, fear of femininity, fear of what it means to be who they are. They are the sissies."
"46","Sissies","1996-12-13","5","Act 4","host","Dan Savage","00:55:45.95","I'm not saying that the closet case who asks gay men not to respond to his ad needs to be a big, swishy queen in order to be true to himself. He just needs to be a man, secure about who he is, a man who isn't ruled by fear, a man willing to show himself to the world. He needs to not be such a sissy."
