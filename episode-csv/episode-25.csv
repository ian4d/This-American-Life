"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","1","Act One. Bulls in Our Hearts","host","Ira Glass","00:00:00.92","The story goes like this. Recently I heard about this couple. He's in his 40s. She's in her mid-20s. And the way it was explained to me, they were having this conversation, and it was one of these conversations that, if you've ever been in a couple with a big age difference, maybe you've taken part in, he was saying basically, what can you see in me? You know, you are so young and energetic and I'm this older person. I'm so much more serious."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","1","Act One. Bulls in Our Hearts","host","Ira Glass","00:00:29.32","And they talked about this and talked about this. And finally, she brought the conversation to a stop by declaring, no, no, no, don't you understand? I am Dennis Rodman. You are Phil Jackson. You ground me. I am wild. You make everything all right. And that's the way it is right now in Chicago, where I speak to you from right now. Our historic championship basketball team, the Chicago Bulls, is not just the winningest team of all time, with 72 regular season wins, now hurtling through the NBA playoffs. What's happened here in Chicago is that the Bulls are now the lens through which we view all of our experiences. They're the benchmark against we're measuring everything in our lives. They've become our reality."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","1","Act One. Bulls in Our Hearts","host","Ira Glass","00:01:32.71","Today, in this hour, a dispatch from a city that has left the rest of the American culture and entered into its own little subculture, a basketball subculture. At nights in Chicago, now the Hancock building, which towers over the city, is lit a bright Bulls-red. Bulls posters and souvenirs and caps and T-shirts are for sale in every video storage and corner drugstore, in bars, everywhere. It's like living in China during the cultural revolution. Slogans and propaganda, everywhere, all uniting us as one people. The name United Center was never more appropriate than now. There we are, united behind the vanguard-- Michael, Scottie, Dennis, Phil, Luke, our vanguard, and all the others."

Act Three, What Basketball Means, stories of people who love the game. Act Four, Basketball and Commerce, in which, among other things, we visit Bulls star Scottie Pippen's car dealership. And Act Five, the greatest moment in radio-- ever. Stay with us."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","2","Act Two. Bulls in a Barber Shop. ","host","Ira Glass","00:03:42.97","Act One, Bulls in Our Hearts. As a way to measure the place of the Bulls in the conscious and unconscious minds of everyday Chicagoans, consider this case, members of the radio jury. Anaheed was watching a game with her parents. They'd driven in from Detroit, the parents did, for her 26th birthday, and started arguing over Dennis Rodman."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","2","Act Two. Bulls in a Barber Shop. ","host","Ira Glass","00:04:10.05","Just a quick word to public radio listeners who perhaps are not following our national basketball pastime as carefully as they might, Dennis Rodman is the player who you may have seen pictures of with the colored hair, the tattoos, the piercings. He's the one who was involved with Madonna for a while, possibly the greatest rebounder of all time. Anaheed's father did not like him. He's a rebel. He's a terrible man. Well, I'll let Anaheed tell the story."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","2","Act Two. Bulls in a Barber Shop. ","subject","Anaheed","00:04:37.22","He said, ""What kind of role model is he? He's no role model. This man is the Antichrist."" And I said, ""I don't think he's the Antichrist, Dad."""
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","2","Act Two. Bulls in a Barber Shop. ","host","Ira Glass","00:04:47.20","What developed between them was the biggest argument Anaheed has had with her parents since she was a child, since she lived at home. It lasted for an hour. And what was remarkable about it is that it got to the most basic issues any family argument can ever get to."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","2","Act Two. Bulls in a Barber Shop. ","subject","Anaheed","00:05:06.12","He said, ""You like this craziness, you are just trying to go against everything of this family. You know that's not what we stand for. You're trying to go against the family. You're trying to divide yourself as much as possible from this family, by liking Dennis Rodman."""
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","2","Act Two. Bulls in a Barber Shop. ","subject","Anaheed","00:05:24.01","All of a sudden, I was back in high school all of a sudden. And he hadn't been so completely-- Like I mean, the fight got to the point where he was telling me, like, that I don't love him, and I'm trying to break up our relationship. He wants to have a good relationship with me. He can't even talk to me, and I don't like him, and I don't respect him. And me telling him, I don't think you listen to me, and I don't think you care about the things that I care about, and you don't even know anything about me."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","2","Act Two. Bulls in a Barber Shop. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:05:52.07","And it's all because of Dennis Rodman."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","2","Act Two. Bulls in a Barber Shop. ","subject","Anaheed","00:05:53.63","And it's all because of little Dennis Rodman."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","2","Act Two. Bulls in a Barber Shop. ","host","Ira Glass","00:05:58.49","It is impossible to imagine fighting like this, Anaheed says, over any other public figure."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","2","Act Two. Bulls in a Barber Shop. ","subject","Anaheed","00:06:04.73","My dad and I are both big basketball fans, and we used to go to Pistons games all the time together when I was in high school, and that was sort of the only thing we had in common. And I think that the NBA to my dad is this really great organization. They're really wonderful, and he really loves the game. And to see somebody like Dennis Rodman sort of flip off the whole organization, I think to him sort of symbolizes me and my role in my family. And everything that I'm doing to him is what Dennis is doing to the NBA."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","2","Act Two. Bulls in a Barber Shop. ","host","Ira Glass","00:06:47.74","Then there are the dreams. I realized a few weeks ago, actually, that even though I had not seen a Bulls game in two years, personally, and even though at the time I really didn't care less about the Bulls-- I wasn't following it at all-- the Bulls are such a presence in everyday life in Chicago-- in conversations, on the street, products, and magazines, and stuff about them everywhere-- that even I was having dreams about them. They had entered my unconscious picture of the world to that extent."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","2","Act Two. Bulls in a Barber Shop. ","host","Ira Glass","00:07:20.05","So anyway, here in Chicago just last week, I went on the radio and I invited Chicagoans to call in and record their dreams about the Bulls. And people responded."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","2","Act Two. Bulls in a Barber Shop. ","subject","Woman 1","00:07:30.39","Maybe five or six months ago, I was at a really stressed out time at work preparing for an audit. I had a dream during that period that the auditing team showed up at my office as planned, only the chief auditor was Michael Jordan. I was really nervous and stressed out. And there's Michael Jordan in my office. And it somehow developed, while I was having a conversation with Michael Jordan about the audit, and I wasn't completely prepared, but he knew I wasn't ready, and he decided that, in exchange for oral sexual favors, he would make sure we passed the audit. And I had a conversation with my boss about it, and my boss was, like, ""Well, I can't really tell you that you should do this, but it's Michael Jordan, how bad can it be?"" And we passed the audit. One of the other really funny things about this is that it's Scottie Pippen who I find absolutely just adorable, not Michael."

"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","2","Act Two. Bulls in a Barber Shop. ","subject","Woman 4","00:09:04.98","I'm in a hot tub with Michael Jordan. And he says to me, ""I love my wife, but you're my best friend."""
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","2","Act Two. Bulls in a Barber Shop. ","host","Ira Glass","00:09:18.37","As weird as the Michael Jordan dreams are, the Dennis Rodman dreams are way weirder. One guy called up to describe a dream in which a mob was attacking Dennis Rodman because he was a Communist. In another dream, somebody else called in to say that a woman said that Dennis appeared in a dream of hers in a feather boa in an appliance store to tell the woman that the playoffs are fixed. It's fixed. It's done. It's fixed."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","2","Act Two. Bulls in a Barber Shop. ","subject","Woman 5","00:09:46.40","I dreamed that Dennis Rodman was swimming in the ocean, and he was way far out, really deep. And everybody was scared that the undertow was going to drag him away."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","2","Act Two. Bulls in a Barber Shop. ","subject","Man 1","00:09:58.57","I had a dream that Dennis Rodman was a woman. And the two of us worked together at White Castle. Except what was interesting about Dennis was that he had no hands. And on one hand, he had a fork, and on the other hand, he had a spoon. And I felt jilted because he wouldn't talk to me. So the majority of my dream was me feeling dissed by the female Dennis Rodman with a fork and a spoon for hands."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","2","Act Two. Bulls in a Barber Shop. ","host","Ira Glass","00:10:36.39","Other people weigh in with their basketball stories, coming up."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","3","Act Three. The Meaning of Basketball","host","Ira Glass","00:11:57.28","Act Two, Bulls in a Barber Shop. A Chicago columnist wrote recently that the Bulls have become the city's royalty, but that does not really capture the half of it. The Bulls are like the soap opera that everyone in the city is watching, with this eccentric cast of characters that we all know. And watching a Bulls game, for most people, is a social event, where everybody swaps stories and theories and predictions."

I visited while the third game of the Eastern Conference playoffs was on the color TV near the door. The Bulls played the Orland Magic."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","3","Act Three. The Meaning of Basketball","host","Ira Glass","00:12:44.80","Richard Coleman, whose chair is nearest the door, was predicting a 15-point Bulls' victory. His brother, James, whose chair is furthest from the screen, is calling for a four-game sweep, Bulls over Orlando. But sandwiched midway between the two brothers, standing in the middle chair, Tommy was the lone dissenter in a crowded room of probably three dozen Bulls fanatics, some of whom, remember, were armed with razors. It took a certain nerve to placidly insist, hour after hour, that Shaquille O'Neal and the Magic were going to pull this series out of the bag."

The Meaning of Basketball","host","Ira Glass","00:13:50.15","A week before, there'd been a big discussion in Coleman Brothers about Dennis Rodman, his multi-colored hair, his tattoos, the fact that he showed up to a book signing in drag. Guys were not crazy about all this. But faced with a microphone, nobody wanted to say anything too negative about the star rebounder. And everyone had found a comfortable way to explain his behavior."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","3","Act Three. The Meaning of Basketball","subject","Man 1","00:14:09.51","I think it's all right. I think they probably say, well, hey, he making money. This is the main thing, you know? Maybe he's doing that in order to make money."

"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","3","Act Three. The Meaning of Basketball","host","Ira Glass","00:15:15.26","The Bulls-Orlando game was a pretty typical Chicago viewing experience.

Jordan's my age, and as my body changes, as joints respond less readily, bruises take longer to heal, and hangovers get harder to cure, I have grown to appreciate MJ's ability to recreate himself. The mad dash fearless dunking of his youth has been replaced by safer, more adult practices. Watch as Michael becomes a post-up player.

It's a car dealership selling Intrepids and Neons and Dodge 4x4s. And right now, during the playoffs, the showrooms are filled with balloons and basketball players made out of balloons. The windows are painted with the words ""Playoff Payoff."" But mostly, it looks like any other Dodge dealership, a little rundown, with posters of Scottie and Bulls insignias here and there."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","host","Ira Glass","00:45:49.75","I figured I should have a real Bulls fan with me when I visited, so I brought Beau O'Reilly, a Chicago playwright and musician and actor who's been on our program here a few times, and a Scottie Pippen fan. He pressed the owner of the dealership, Nick Farschi, for details about Pippen. But really, what's the guy going to say?"
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","subject","Nick Farschi","00:46:07.39","Probably one of the nicest people you ever get to meet."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","interviewer","Beau O'reilly","00:46:10.92","He seems publicly to be a very soft-spoken person, very kind of quiet person usually."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","subject","Nick Farschi","00:46:17.26","That's exactly how he is. He's real soft-spoken. He hardly ever gets mad. And when he does get mad, then you'll know."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","interviewer","Beau O'reilly","00:46:26.83","What does he drive?"
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","subject","Nick Farschi","00:46:29.27","I think he owns a Porsche, and a Mercedes, and a Land Rover. Occasionally he drives a conversion van in the summertime."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","host","Ira Glass","00:46:40.19","Note that only the last of these, the conversion van, can actually be purchased at the Scottie Pippen Dodge store. When offered a chance to lie and push some Dodge product, owner Nick Farschi actually seemed to answer our questions honestly, to his credit. He admitted that Scottie only drops in once every couple months, that Scottie is paid a fee for the use of his name, and the business has increased a total of 10% or 15% since they put Scottie's name above the door. People do come in hoping to meet Scottie, or simply to get near the Scottie Pippen magic."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","host","Ira Glass","00:47:09.04","And Nick Farschi said that, during 1994, when Scottie had a bad year on the court, walked out of a game with 1.8 seconds left, was arrested for carrying an illegal gun, was accused of domestic violence, well, sales did suffer."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","subject","Nick Farschi","00:47:21.27","The business slowed down a little bit. People were nervous. It was almost like a disaster [UNINTELLIGIBLE]."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","host","Ira Glass","00:47:27.89","Live by the celebrity endorsement, die by the celebrity endorsement. And there is, after all, something a little strange about buying a car from a dealership whose spokesman can sometimes be a bully on the basketball court. I mean, would you want the salesman to knock you around the way that Scottie hurls himself at, say, the New York Knicks. Mr. Farschi says this question misses the point."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","subject","Nick Farschi","00:47:48.53","When people come in here, they're not in competition with Scottie, so that's-- When they come in here and buy a car from him, they're on Scottie's team."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","host","Ira Glass","00:47:57.78","And one way the Scottie Pippen Dodge store makes you feel like you are on Scottie's team is that they let you visit his private office, built specially on the premises, with glass windows looking out onto the showroom. Mr. Farschi was kind enough to open it up for Beau and I."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","host","Ira Glass","00:48:17.11","The office is paneled with dark, expensive-looking wood. It's much more luxurious than Mr. Farschi's office, though it's clear from the moment you enter that no one does any work here. There are no papers, no clutter. On the wall are a few not-terribly significant mementos, a picture with the '93 Olympic Dream Team, a license plate with Scottie's number, 33, on it. There's a mini refrigerator, though Beau and I didn't have the nerve to look inside. Beau did take a peek at the private bathroom and saw Scottie's toilet. The most personal positions in the office are a picture of Scottie's dogs, and some amusements."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:48:48.93","What's the parrot?"
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","subject","Nick Farschi","00:48:50.72","That's just a toy. It's just a toy that he plays with when he's here. When he's here, usually he shoots hoops on the wall, and he practices."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","interviewer","Beau O'reilly","00:49:01.30","He shoots like a little Nerf basketball?"
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","subject","Nick Farschi","00:49:03.69","Yeah."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","interviewer","Beau O'reilly","00:49:05.88","But how does he play with the parrot? What does it do?"
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","subject","Nick Farschi","00:49:08.01","It just repeats everything around that you say."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","interviewer","Beau O'reilly","00:49:09.97","Oh. [LAUGHS] Well, that's convenient. Can we get it to talk to us?"
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","subject","Nick Farschi","00:49:16.61","Sure."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","subject","Beau O'reilly","00:49:17.36","Let's try it."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","subject","Nick Farschi","00:49:18.82","Try it."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","interviewer","Beau O'reilly","00:49:22.21","You push the button?"
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","subject","Nick Farschi","00:49:22.99","Now just say hello."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","interviewer","Beau O'reilly","00:49:24.43","Hello, here we are at the Scottie Pippen's store."

"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","subject","Parrot","00:49:36.64","Ha, ha, ha, ha."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","interviewer","Beau O'reilly","00:49:38.48","I can see him playing with that all day. Well, here, we'll leave a message for Scottie."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","subject","Parrot","00:49:42.79","Well, here, we'll leave a message for Scot--"
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","interviewer","Beau O'reilly","00:49:44.26","Thanks Scottie, for letting us visit you here in your office here at the Scottie Pippen store."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","host","Ira Glass","00:49:50.21","Mr. Farschi guesses that if Scottie does well and the Bulls win the NBA Finals, it could mean as many as 15 or 20 extra Dodge vans, trucks, and cars sold from this store. If the Scottie Pippen Dodge store is the most understated Bulls-related business, in this, our fair city, with no TV ads, barely any Bulls hype, the most garish manifestation of the merchandising of basketball is downtown on Michigan Avenue, a combination shoe store and museum called Niketown."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","host","Ira Glass","00:50:26.28","Niketown is the size of a small department store, reportedly grosses $2.5 million in sales each week. Inside, there are statues of athletes in midair, a 20-foot banner of Michael Jordan with a quote from William Blake underneath, display cases with sports memorabilia, slogans everywhere, like ""Play to Win,"" ""Total Body Conditioning,"" ""Test Your Faith,"" on long banners hung in a mock socialist, WPA style. When you go inside Niketown, there are 18 separate pavilions, each with its own kind of sight and sound environment, like a real basketball court floor, and the sounds of squeaking sneakers on hardwood in the area that sells basketball stuff, the sound of tennis balls being hit in another area where they sell tennis stuff."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","5","Act Five. One More Dream","host","Ira Glass","00:51:11.84","As the writer, Andrew Levy, points out-- it's from a piece he wrote-- ""The buying of goods invokes a sequence of events and images that make the purchase itself playful. Items move from the fourth-floor storeroom to the cashier stations through clear plastic tubes rimmed with green neon that suggest, as they are meant to, the cartoon future of the Jetsons. The direct purchase of goods is designed to appear to be an afterthought. The retail areas are cramped compared to the open atriums designed for the display of art and statuary. And the store's design requires every entering customer to be distracted by considerable aesthetics before reaching any locale where Nike items can actually be purchased. There are whimsical, anarchic features everywhere in Niketown. Tropical fish swim in a 22-foot, 1,000-gallon tank behind the hiking shoe display. A bank of nine television screens embedded beneath the floor nearby flashes images of glimmering swimming pools and waterfalls. It is seductive and very effective at creating sales."""

"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","6","Act 5","host","Ira Glass","00:53:40.47","Act Five, One More Dream."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","6","Act 5","subject","Brett Grossman","00:53:43.05","This dream was probably the biggest dream in my life as far as changing the way I was."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","6","Act 5","host","Ira Glass","00:53:51.51","We began this hour with dreams about the Bulls. And the most intense dream that anybody came to us with about the Bulls came from a guy named Brett Grossman. In his dream, Michael Jordan appears both as Brett's dead father and as Christ, healing and taking away pain. Brett says that he's had other dreams where Michael Jordan is crucified on a cross made of baseball bats."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","6","Act 5","host","Ira Glass","00:54:12.48","But in this dream, the one that changed his life, there are kind of two big scenes. One is this traumatic event in Brett's life, where his father died when he was a kid, which he feels a lot of pain about. And the other is this scene where there's a huge coliseum, like a Roman coliseum, and in the middle there's a basketball court, and there's Michael Jordan on the court alone, trying to make a shot, trying to jump and lift off the ground."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","6","Act 5","subject","Brett Grossman","00:54:37.50","And I'm feeling like Michael Jordan, something is grabbing him, pulling him down. And he's just, with all his strength, he's just jumping as high as he can. And it's like there's this pressure from below that's just ripping on him, pulling him down. And he's just suspended in there, as if his will and the pressure of the world and the gravity are at complete odds and smashing against each other, and his body is just ripping apart."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","6","Act 5","subject","Brett Grossman","00:55:03.60","And the whole entire crowd erupts. Everyone's screaming, going crazy. But it's this maniacal-- It's like we're all watching someone being killed. And every time the ball dribbles, my pain becomes a little less, and Michael Jordan is just grimacing. And no one's going to help him, and I'm sitting there feeling like my pain is becoming less and then lessening. And there was all this pain that Michael Jordan had absorbed for me. And somehow, Michael Jordan, though, had, for this one second, basically neutralized a pain that I had felt my whole life, and this pain with my father, and a pain of just your existence, of being alone."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","6","Act 5","subject","Brett Grossman","00:55:43.83","And for this one second, I could feel it. It was the first time in my life that I ever-- and I woke up from the dream-- I ever realized that that's a possibility, that pain is something that you don't necessarily need to feel all the time to understand it."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","6","Act 5","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:56:06.58"," Why Michael Jordan? If you're going to have a dream like this, why Michael Jordan?"
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","6","Act 5","subject","Brett Grossman","00:56:12.10","Because there's thing, there's Michael Jordan, and you see it in his eyes. And it happened during the Miami series of this year. I don't know how it is, but his eyes turn inward. He becomes very serious and solemn. And you feel that he is taking everyone on the team and just taking all their faults, all their backaches, all their problems, all their ego trips, and he's cushioning them for them. He's saying, ""Look, I'm Michael Jordan, I'm going to win the game, you know that, stop. Just let it all loose and we're going to win the game."""
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","6","Act 5","subject","Brett Grossman","00:56:46.07","And I mean, I'll be at home watching the game on my chair, with my bottle of water, going crazy. And I see Michael's eyes and suddenly it's like, OK, I can relax, he's going to win it for me. And that feeling, it's crazy, but that feeling is something that I think you get from a god, and you get that from, whether false or not, you get that from a religion and an idol."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","6","Act 5","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:57:11.43","That here's somebody who's going to solve my problems and heal my pain."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","6","Act 5","subject","Brett Grossman","00:57:16.26","Heal my pain and take away the indecision. There's nothing to worry about, because he's going to win the game."
"25","Basketball","1996-06-07","6","Act 5","host","Ira Glass","00:57:34.58","Well, hopefully, we Chicagoans will get to see that look in Michael Jordan's eyes again soon."
