"12","Animals","1996-01-31","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:12.68"," So when I heard that a woman named Samantha Martin had trained raccoons to play basketball, and hires them out for parties and corporate events, I pictured raccoons. You know, in three-on-three or four-on-four games, in little Chicago Bulls uniforms. You know, Raccoon Scottie Pippen passes to Raccoon Dennis Rodman. Raccoon Michael Jordan, you know, takes it in for a layup or dunks it. The team is a little raccoon Orlando Magic or Los Angeles Lakers. I could see it all. But that is not what it was like. No, no, no. That was naive."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","1","Prologue","subject","Samantha Martin","00:00:50.70"," Ricky. Come here, Ricky. Ricky, Ricky. Snacks, hmm? There you go. Shoo. Shoo. Ricky, shoo. Come on, Ricky. Ricky, come here."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:03.41","Samantha Martin chases after one of her two basketball-playing raccoons, holding a bag of blue and pink cotton candy. She alternates, actually, between taking a fingerful of cotton candy for herself and giving one to the raccoon."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","1","Prologue","subject","Samantha Martin","00:01:13.58"," Yummy. Sugar. Sugar, Ricky. Come here. You don't want the snacks? Ricky, Ricky, Ricky."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:20.41","Samantha is actually a skilled and successful trainer, but the animals are not cooperating this day, probably because Samantha went away for the holidays and they're still feeling neglected. Samantha puts a grapefruit-sized ball in the raccoon's hand and then pushes the raccoon's hand toward a Fisher-Price basketball net that rises perhaps a foot and a half off the floor."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","1","Prologue","subject","Samantha Martin","00:01:36.84"," Oh, she missed. Shoot again. Shoot. Good girl."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:43.60","The fact is, there are things that raccoons like to do, are born to do. And playing basketball is not one of them."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","1","Prologue","subject","Samantha Martin","00:01:49.54","Oh, I know. It's frustrating. You have to have a lot of patience. Especially when I was first training them to play basketball, do you know how long it took me? It took me a month to get them to play basketball. Every day I had to come down here and play with ball, net, ball, net, treat. And you just see, going through their mind-- OK, if they touched the ball and then they touched the net, they'd get a treat. They'd be like ball, net, treat, treat. And then, I started getting them to hold the ball, and then I got them to push the ball into the net."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","1","Prologue","subject","Samantha Martin","00:02:18.40","And finally that day came where they picked up the ball off the ground and popped it in the net. And I was so thrilled. I was like, oh, they got it. He got excited. He was like, [PANTING SOUNDS] and he was picking up the ball and putting it in the net, picking up the ball and putting it in the net, over and over again. He got so excited."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:42.63","Taming animals means basically teaching them to conform to the human world, teaching them human expectations. And with many of the animals that Samantha raises, it's possible to make them more human while they're little. But then once they reach a certain age, their real animal nature kicks in. A baby cougar she was raising started stalking her friends, biting at their throats. The raccoons also go for the throat."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","1","Prologue","subject","Samantha Martin","00:03:07.08","You know, if he's out of his cage, he'll run up. He'll look at you, and he'll recognize me as, like, Mom from years ago. He'll be like, Mom, and he'll race up to me, jump up, climb up to my shoulder, and then realize, wait, I'm wild, I don't like you anymore. And he'll bite my neck."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","1","Prologue","subject","Samantha Martin","00:03:27.54","You see it inside. Their eyes go from crazy to tame, crazy to tame, crazy, crazy, tame, tame. It's almost like they're saying, no, Mom, love you-- must bite, must bite, must-- no, no, nice, nice, Mom, nice, oh, yes, we love Mom-- bite, must bite, must bite-- no, no. They just fight it. You just see this battle going on in their heads. They're like, [SOUNDS OF STRUGGLING]."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:03:56.09","What do we want from animals? To run her business, Samantha has had to figure this out, and at parties, at corporate events, in commercials and films, Samantha has her raccoons pick pockets and play basketball. She has rats that bowl, rats that answer toy telephones?"
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:04:10.15","Do people want to see animals do animal things?"
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","1","Prologue","subject","Samantha Martin","00:04:13.20","No, they don't. They want to see animals acting like people."

"12","Animals","1996-01-31","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:04:52.90","Act One, Staging the Food Chain in a New York Apartment."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:04:56.66","Act Two, Animal Court. That's an original radio play by David Sedaris."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:05:01.91","Act Three, The Moment Humans Stopped Being Animals. That's a story by Scott Carrier. Stay with us."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","host","Ira Glass","00:05:17.88"," Act One. You know, usually when we see pictures of animals, they're fluffy and cute or they are noble and dignified. Well, compare that to this set of photos by Catherine Chalmers. In this first picture, we have a caterpillar eating a tomato, a brightly-colored close up of that. In the second picture, a praying mantis eats the caterpillar. And in the third picture, a tarantula eats the praying mantis. Catherine Chalmers takes these pictures in her own apartment in New York City, where she also raises the animals that she feeds to each other. Paul Tough stopped by for a visit."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","host","Paul Tough","00:05:54.08"," Growing up, Catherine Chalmers wasn't really an animal person. She always had a pet or two, nothing unusual. Then a few years ago, she was working on these sculptures where she would take dead insects and glue them onto plants and flowers. She needed a lot of dead flies, more than she could buy anywhere, and so she decided to start raising live flies in a glass cage in the corner of her apartment. She would just let them breed and wait for them to die. But then one day, she picked up a camera and looked at the flies through a close-up lens."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:06:23.65"," And the world changed. Because instead of just seeing patterns of swarming flies, I saw leg hairs and genitals and mouths and I saw them. And I saw their lives, how they would greet each other, and what they would do. And I could see them being born. I could see them having sex. I could see them eating. I could see them flying. I could see them hanging out. And it was great. It was fascinating. So I'd sit there for hours until they went to the bathroom on the glass enough that I couldn't see anymore. And that's when I kind of got hooked into animals past a certain point of return."

"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:07:34.14","When I first thought of this project, when it first dawned on me, what I was kind of fishing around for, it kind of made my stomach hurt. The idea of raising animals to be eaten, to photograph them specifically to be eaten, was repugnant and made me kind of sick. But the more I thought of it, the more interesting I thought it was."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","host","Paul Tough","00:08:00.35","And so Catherine began to fill her loft with animals. There isn't much furniture, but every surface has got terrariums and cages on it. Frogs and mealworms and a snake on one table. Goldfish in the kitchen to feed the frogs. Crickets which chirp constantly. A tarantula and two cages full of mice. On a spare corner of the table where the frogs and the snake live, she's got a lightbox set up, and we sit down there to take a look at some of her pictures."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:08:26.75",""
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","host","Paul Tough","00:08:32.32","The photos don't look like normal nature photography. They look more like fashion shots. The animals are brightly lit and sharply focused, pictured against a clear white background."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:08:44.83","It starts with caterpillars that eat tomatoes. The praying mantises eat the caterpillars. And my original idea was for the tarantula to eat the praying mantises. But spiders are really undependable predators."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","host","Paul Tough","00:09:01.68","If there were two emotions competing in Catherine Chalmers, her fascination with the food chain and her disgust with what she was doing, it becomes clear to me, as she shows me her work, that in the end, her fascination won out. She lays out a sequence of shots that begin with the praying mantis about to attack a caterpillar."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:09:19.80","That's the part that's really great, is she springs on it, and she wraps her arms around it. And she just starts biting into it. And the thing's live and it's still kicking. And with the caterpillars, since all they do is eat, basically their body is just one long digestive system. And so whatever they are eating, as soon as she bites into it, it just spills out. So if they're eating leaves when she bites into it-- and this totally surprised me when it first happened. It comes out green, or it comes out bright red, the color of the tomatoes, or it comes out bright yellow, if you're feeding them yellow tomatoes. So I did different sequences of caterpillar with different color guts coming out."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:10:04.50","And it was just beautiful. I mean, I didn't know that an animal eating something live could be so attractive. It was like spilling a tube of paint out on a white piece of canvas. It just blobs out. It's gruesome, if you think about it in terms of your brother or your sister, but in terms of the fact that it is an insect and we seem less attached to the insect world than, certainly, the human world, it was very beautiful."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","host","Paul Tough","00:10:40.53","You'd think it would be easy to take pictures of predators eating their prey. That's what they do, after all. But it turns out to be more complicated than just putting a couple of animals together and snapping away. There are considerations of timing and staging. When she tried to have frogs eat the praying mantises, the problem was the frogs were simply too fast. Photo One would show a hungry frog and a praying mantis, and Photo Two would just show a well-fed frog."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","host","Paul Tough","00:11:04.90","Then there was the tarantula problem. Tarantulas can go for months without eating and days without moving. She put the spider and the praying mantis up on her set, and the tarantula would just stare at the praying mantis, completely still, one leg in the air, for hours. Finally in one session at three in the morning, after staring through her camera all night, Catherine got what she wanted. She slides the photos onto the lightbox."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:11:30.66","You see the shot where the two of them are looking at each other. And then basically the spider pounced on it and flipped it over. And the praying mantis is upside-down, still looking straight at you and perfectly alive, looking at you, as the spider is munching on the middle part of its body. And then you see his head, and his antennas are waving around, and then slowly the head gets drawn more and more into the jaws. And it's still alive. And then the spider basically mushes it up into a ball and extracts the juices out of it."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:12:12.05","And it took maybe, I can't remember, maybe three or four hours for it to eat the whole thing. And for at least half of that time, the praying mantis was perfectly alive. And it was hard, because you'd spent so long raising this thing. It was really hard to see it being eaten alive like that and having it take so long."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","host","Paul Tough","00:12:37.37",""
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:12:44.20","I got attached to the praying mantises. Yeah, seeing the praying mantises die was definitely much harder than seeing the caterpillars dying. Unlike most insects, they have a head that moves, like ours does, on a neck. And so they turn and they look at you. And they've got these big eyes sticking out. And they have some of the characteristics of the things which usually win human sympathy, which is big eyes and kind of an expression. And their mouth is red on the inside. So when they would eat something, it looked like they had red lipstick on. It was much easier to get attached to them."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","host","Paul Tough","00:13:19.68",""
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","host","Paul Tough","00:13:51.62","At the lightbox, she puts down four new photos from a different project, a series of shots of two praying mantises having sex."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:14:04.38","So that's the female. That's the male. She's a lot bigger. Then they mated. They look like a nice happy couple. He has green eyes. She has brown."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","interviewer","Paul Tough","00:14:17.28","So he's on top of her."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:14:18.32","He's on top of her. And it's just like a classic doggy-style sex position. And they stay that way for hours. Hours and hours and hours. I mean, I'll take a few pictures, come back in 20 minutes, take a few more pictures, come back in 20 minutes."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","interviewer","Paul Tough","00:14:35.43","Isn't that kind of rare for animals? I thought animals were sort of-- do it quick."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:14:39.24","So did I, especially insects. I don't know. I think it's somewhat rare. I was surprised. I mean I've waited four hours and finally just went to bed and woke up in the morning, and the male is nowhere to be found."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:14:53.91","But then one time, instead of him getting completely off of her, she caught him and wrapped her arms around him, like she was holding him around the neck, like walking arm in arm. And she just started eating him. I couldn't believe it. I've mated them two years in a row now and hadn't had them do that."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","host","Paul Tough","00:15:18.60","The photos aren't exactly grisly. There's no blood, not really even any color, but they're still pretty disturbing."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:15:25.07","Here, you see he's still kind of halfway on, and she reached around and grabbed him by the neck and bit his face off. See, he has no head there."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","interviewer","Paul Tough","00:15:37.96","What's that?"
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:15:39.28","Oh, that's one of his arms. There was kind of a fight. It's like the tip somewhere. And she's eating straight down his abdomen. See, he's already past his waist. Whatever. She finished when she got there. She even ate some of the wings, munched on some of those."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","interviewer","Paul Tough","00:16:01.57","And when does he die?"
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:16:03.94","When does he die?"
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","interviewer","Paul Tough","00:16:06.38","Do you think he's dead there?"
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:16:08.95","Well, insects, it's like their bodies are more democratic. They don't have a central nervous system the same way we do. You bite their head off, and the whole theory is that their body keeps functioning. So she can bite his head off when they're in this position, having sex, and he continues to have sex with her and continues to give her sperm, or whatever they call it in bug stuff. And there were some scientists who measured the inside of her cavity. And when she bit his head off, she got more sperm. So his head actually acted as an inhibitor, and when that's gone, then she gets the rest. So in the cases where the female bit the head off, she actually got more sperm. I suppose theoretically, therefore, more of her eggs are fertilized."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","interviewer","Paul Tough","00:17:05.48","What do you mean, his head acts as an inhibitor?"
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:17:08.96","Well, he's very cautious around her. And his caution seems to originate in his head. So at this point, he's definitely still alive, when she's only eaten his face off."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","host","Paul Tough","00:17:27.77","At the center of Catherine's studio, there are two glass cages where her mice live. There are about 20 mice in each cage, of all ages. Some have just been born, still nursing from their mothers, some pregnant, some have been around for a few generations. It's the nicest part of the studio. The mice are all very clean and healthy and cute, and the cage even smells good. These mice are the centerpiece of Catherine's current project. She photographs them being born, and then photographs them being eaten by various predators."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","host","Paul Tough","00:18:05.56","Today she's going to take pictures of a two-day-old mouse, which is called a pinkie because it's too young to have fur. It just has pink skin. Its eyes are still closed, and it can barely move. Her 10-inch, pencil-thin snake, Pumpkin, hasn't eaten in almost a week. Today, Pumpkin's going to eat a pinkie."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","host","Paul Tough","00:18:25.53","She puts the pinkie and the snake up on what she calls her set. This is where she takes all her pictures. It's chest-high, about three feet by three feet, with a white Formica surface that curves up at the back to form a seamless background. There are only two strobe lights, plus a third light underneath the surface to make sure the animals stay warm."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","interviewer","Paul Tough","00:18:43.55","Do you have to keep the snake away from the pinkie when you first put it down?"
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:18:46.95","No. It takes a while to figure out that it's there."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","interviewer","Paul Tough","00:18:51.42","Now, the pinkie started moving. Do you think--"
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:18:53.60","No. I don't think the pinkie understands there's a snake there."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","host","Paul Tough","00:18:57.65","The snake's moving slowly, putting its head up right next to the pinkie and flicking out its tongue as if it wants to lick it."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:19:05.90","She's checking it out, smelling it, sniffing it, making sure it's OK, I guess."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","interviewer","Paul Tough","00:19:15.59","It's very friendly."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:19:19.44","I don't know if I'd call it friendly."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","interviewer","Paul Tough","00:19:21.79"," I mean it just looks that way, the two of them together."

"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","interviewer","Paul Tough","00:19:34.84","But the mouse doesn't look that happy."

"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","host","Paul Tough","00:19:45.65"," stood there for 15 minutes watching as the snake tried to decide what to do. The pinkie didn't move much, just sort of quivered, raising its head every once in a while. Then, finally, the snake made its move."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:20:00.97"," Hmm. Very strange."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","host","Paul Tough","00:20:05.97","What was strange was the way the snake attacked. Pumpkin is a constrictor, which means that usually when it goes for its prey, it quickly wraps its body around it and squeezes it to death."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:20:20.41","It hasn't happened like this before."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","host","Paul Tough","00:20:25.12","This time it bit the pinkie and held it in its fangs, alive, for a couple of minutes before it finally constricted it."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","interviewer","Paul Tough","00:20:34.45","Does the pinkie always struggle like that?"
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:20:36.67","No, and it has never squealed before."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","interviewer","Paul Tough","00:20:45.24","What's the difference, do you think?"
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:20:47.48","The pinkie was bigger, older."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","interviewer","Paul Tough","00:20:53.33","Is it still alive now?"
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:20:55.86","If you look at the tail, you can usually tell. When the tail starts to droop down. Although it's getting so much blood pushed through there that that could keep it up."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","interviewer","Paul Tough","00:21:10.73","I know you can be charged for being cruel to a dog. Can you be charged for being cruel to a mouse?"
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","2","Act One. Food Chain In A New York Apartment","subject","Catherine Chalmers","00:21:18.70","No, I don't think so.

Right now, Pumpkin can't eat anything bigger than a pinkie, but she's growing. Eventually she'll be three feet or more. Before long, she'll be eating full-grown mice, the ones that Catherine feeds and holds and plays with every day."

It can't see. It can smell, but it can't see. But it's another when you pick up a full-grown mouse who is aware of what's going on when it sees a snake. And I don't know what I'm going to do when she starts eating full-grown mice. Right now, it's still something within the realm of something I can do. I don't know. Is there a line at which it starts being hard to do? Yeah, probably."

The snake doesn't really seem to care if the mouse squeals or not. Is it any different to the mouse? Yeah, maybe a little bit, but it's dying anyways. It dies a little faster, or it dies a little slower possibly. So I cared more. The snake didn't care. Who knows if the mouse did. So who matters? Whose opinion do I go by here? Why should I go mine?"

There's a bulge about a third of the way down the snake's body where the pinkie is being digested. Before I leave, Catherine pours us a glass of wine, and we sit on the floor for a little while playing with a couple of her full-grown mice, letting them run over our hands and up our arms. They're tiny and warm, and through their fur, we can feel their little hearts beating."

The defendant herself, the spaniel Kathleen, engaged in destruction against this thing's sweater. She used it as a sort of an appetite-whetter. She gnawed at the fabric and tugged at the collar, and knowing no way I could stop her or stall her, I stood a mute witness. I watched in disgust. I think it's appalling. I find it unjust.

If you ask anthropologists the moment that humans divide off from the animal kingdom, it's the moment that our ape-like ancestors started walking upright on two legs. For people who don't believe that God created the earth in six days, that moment is our origin. That's our Book of Genesis. That is the mythic point where we began. But nobody knows why these pre-humans started walking around on two legs instead of loping around on all fours the way that most animals do. There are different theories but no consensus among scientists."

"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","host","Scott Carrier","00:44:34.57"," We had good reasons for what we were doing. One was that it seemed entirely possible. Another had to do with an argument concerning human evolution. It's a scientific argument, so it takes a few minutes to explain."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","host","Scott Carrier","00:44:51.90","Remember the scene in 2001, where an ape-man realizes he can use a bone as a weapon and murders another ape-man? Then he throws the bone in the air and it becomes a space station orbiting the earth. The theory behind this scene is that we separated from the apes when we stood upright and freed our hands to make and use tools, especially weapon-type tools for hunting and killing other animals. It's called the hunting hypothesis, and there's nothing wrong with it except that we don't have any physical evidence to support it. We just haven't found any tools or weapons that are that old."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","host","Scott Carrier","00:45:30.59","Well, some of the work that my brother does as a biologist made him interested in another theory of human evolution. You might call it the running hypothesis. He believed that he and I were probably good enough runners to be able to run down big game without using any weapons at all. And he thought that if we could do it, then maybe our early ancestors could have done it too."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","host","Scott Carrier","00:45:54.80","Shortly before we went to Wyoming, I went to see Owen Lovejoy. He teaches anthropology at Kent State University. We talked about the running hypothesis, and he thought it was pretty funny."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","subject","Owen Lovejoy","00:46:10.63"," I mean, think about it for a minute. I mean, what game are they going to run down? Things like wildebeest or something?"
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:46:20.90"," Uh-huh. Zebra."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","subject","Owen Lovejoy","00:46:22.31","And they're just going to start off running after this thing without any advanced weaponry of any kind. They've got no spears, no bow and arrow, and they just start running after a wildebeest."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:46:35.36","Yeah. Well, I think that's the idea, that they--"
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","subject","Owen Lovejoy","00:46:40.23"," Uh-huh. The weak link in that whole behavior that you're describing is the inability of the animal to run any faster because it's so damn slow. And it's so damn slow because it's a clumsy biped. Is that an animal adapted to hunting? Slow, awkward, little, no olfaction, no protective vision. If it were an effective quadruped, it could do everything that you're describing in half the time. I mean, imagine a bunch of Paiute Indians that could run as rapidly and as successful as a German Shepherd dog. They'd catch the thing in three minutes and devour it."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","host","Scott Carrier","00:47:20.51"," Well, I just happen to have a German Shepherd, and I take him with me when I go running."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:47:26.87"," Let's go."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","host","Unspecified","00:47:33.84","And Lovejoy's right. He's a better runner than I am. In fact, most of the time, he'd rather have me take my bicycle. So there's no question about me being slower. But as far as being clumsy, Lovejoy calls bipedalism clumsy because of reasons that have to do with biomechanics. Running bipedally takes twice as much energy as running quadrupedally That is, when my dog and I run, he uses half the energy that I do. So Lovejoy and many other anthropologists think it's crazy to assume that the survival strategy of the early hominids involved running after quadrupeds. They've just got us beat, both in terms of speed and efficiency."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","host","Unspecified","00:48:16.90","But the thing is, if my dog and I go running in the summer in the middle of the day, when temperatures hit 85 to 100 or more degrees, it's a whole different ballgame. He'll come with me and run for a while, but then he walks and lags behind. And sometimes he just goes home. So if I'm an awkward and clumsy biped, why can I outrun my dog?"
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","host","Unspecified","00:48:40.18","Well, it's because he overheats. The main way that he and most other quadrupeds cool themselves when they run is by breathing. The air coming in and going out of their mouth evaporates water off their tongues. We do this too, but we do it all over our body by sweating, and then we get a nice flow of air directly over our skin, because we don't have a fur coat. So we can't run as fast as a quadruped, but we can run farther, especially in high heat. And when you remember that we're using twice the energy, this seems like a very strange biological paradox. And it was this paradox, combined with the argument about not being able to hunt without tools, that made my brother and I decide that it was time to try to run down an antelope."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","host","Unspecified","00:49:30.79","Antilocapra americana, the pronghorn, the second-fastest land mammal on the planet. We thought that if we could keep one running for two hours on a hot day, we'd have it beat."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:49:54.12"," What happened?"
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","subject","Man","00:49:56.06"," They didn't give me a chance. I was able to follow them for about 30 minutes, but the problem was I wasn't sure if I was following the same ones I started following. Because I started out following four-- a buck, two does, and a younger one. And after about 10 minutes, they ran into a group of about five more antelope, went over a hill. And then on the other side of the hill, they broke into two groups again. And so I think I ended up following the same four, but I couldn't be sure. And I followed them for another 15 minutes, and then they ran into a much larger group, ran for a ways. And I followed that larger group for a while, and then that group broke into at least two more groups."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","subject","Man","00:50:46.66","And at that point I just sort of gave up and quit following them, because I didn't know which individuals I was chasing. And then I got confused on the roads. Where's the road we were on? Down here? OK, what happened was I came out on this road, way over there somewhere. And I got lost. I didn't know, really, where I was. I was walking along that road for about 15 minutes. I felt like that was the wrong direction. So we started over there. They ran a circle there. I don't remember crossing this road, but I must have, originally, early on."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:51:27.15","This one?"

We quickly realized we knew nothing about the animal we were chasing or the land we were running on. We ran after several herds that first day without much success. That night, sleeping out, I remember feeling very high in terms of elevation, like being dizzy. There weren't any clouds in the sky, and it just seemed like too much open space. Satellites in orbit, the moon in orbit, and antelope in the bushes, chewing their cuds and laughing amongst themselves."

"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","host","Unspecified","00:53:42.47"," We saw dust devils, horned toads, an eagle. We found a small lake, some badlands, and a rattlesnake."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","interviewer","Scott Carrier","00:54:11.15","Wow."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","host","Unspecified","00:54:16.05","It never did get very hot that day, but in the afternoon, we had a good long chase after a female and two males. They ran in circles around an area of about 10 square miles. There were two hills and a long smooth valley in between, and the chase went up and around and back and forth between these hills, the antelope running short periods of time but covering long distances and then stopping and waiting for us to catch up. The two males ran behind the female, as if they were trying to protect her, and sometimes they'd all go in different directions, but we stayed behind the female and the males would eventually rejoin her."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","host","Unspecified","00:54:58.09","One thing we'd learned the day before was that we could run much less distance than the antelopes by staying well inside their circle, and we were also starting to communicate with each other over long distances. For instance, if my brother was on top of one of the hills, and he could see where the antelope were going, he'd point, and I wouldn't have to run to the top of the hill. So we were running after these three and feeling pretty good about not letting them ditch us, and a couple times, we even got within 50 yards of them. And I'd look into their eyes, trying to see some sign of fear or fatigue, but all I kept seeing were very quiet animals that seemed to know exactly who we were, what we were proposing, and didn't seem to be in the least bit worried."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","host","Unspecified","00:55:43.03","Anyway, we ran after these three for about an hour, and then they found a large herd, or the herd found them. And they ran up and over a hill, and by the time we got to the top of the hill, the herd had split into three groups of about three or four antelopes each. And each of the groups seemed to have at least one female that looked exactly like the one we'd started chasing-- the magic shell game trick again. We weren't really all that physically tired, mainly mentally beaten, and we went home."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","host","Unspecified","00:56:21.09","I haven't gone back to Wyoming for the purpose of chasing antelope, but I drive through there sometimes on my way somewhere else. And one time last spring I was going east, and there was a train along the highway also going east at about the same speed. And suddenly there were three antelope running alongside the engine, chasing it. It was incredible. It was even more incredible to see the three of them simultaneously speed up, pull out in front of the engine, and fly across the tracks."
"12","Animals","1996-01-31","4","Act Three. The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals","host","Unspecified","00:56:56.83","I pulled over and waited for the train to go by, and there they were. Three young males, looking back at me with those same black eyes and hardly breathing at all."
