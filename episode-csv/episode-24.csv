"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:06.73"," All right, now this moment from the life of a teenage girl in these United States."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:11.44","School has just let out. Perfect spring day. Kara and her boyfriend, Jeremy, come outside, and he jumps on her back."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Kara","00:00:18.55"," Get off me. Jeremy, come on. You're hurting my back."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Jeremy","00:00:22.40"," You love it."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Kara","00:00:23.10"," I don't."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:23.77"," When I recorded this, I'd been doing documentary radio stories on Kara and her friends for two years. So it was natural that at this point, Kara would just turn to me and say--"
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Kara","00:00:33.30"," Ira, kick his butt. Get away from me. You're too violent. Jeremy, stop."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:42.67",""
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:12.87","And to consider the question of what it's like to be a teenager in America today, consider this incident between Kara and Jeremy and their friends. They had just come outside after a rehearsal for a school play that Kara is putting together based on the writings of Henry Rollins. And if you don't know his work, Henry Rollins is a pop star. He plays this sort of testosterone-loaded post-punk rock. And at the time of this recording, he was Kara's favorite writer."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:01:42.18"," So, Kara, do you have a favorite piece in the Rollins show?"
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Kara","00:01:44.87"," ""Ladies, you want equality."""
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:47.21"," She pulls out the papers that comprise the show's script, and she reads to me. And I should say here that Rollins and our 18-year-old teenager get rather graphic here in a way that might not be suitable for younger listeners. Rollins, in this poem, says that guys are basically scum. Basically just scum. His vision is very unambiguous. They're scum. And he gives heartfelt advice to all women who he addresses as ""ladies."""
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Kara","00:02:13.84"," ""If you want equality to men, it's not going to come to you in the mail or in your sleep. You're going to have to take it, grab hold of it, wrench it out of their hairy-fisted grasp. What I'm getting to is this-- go to the gunsmiths, get a 0.357 magnum with a long barrel. Load it. Put in your bag. Go on with your life."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Kara","00:02:30.09","OK, it's just another day. You're walking down the street. You pass this gas station. Some gas station attendant is standing there, glaring at you, checking you out, smiling at you. This ugly, greasy, stupid guy comes over to you and blocks your way as you try to walk down the street. He breathes on you and says, hey, baby, looky here, seven inches. You pull out the gun, stick the barrel in his face, and scream, I've got eight mother [BLEEP], I've got eight."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Kara","00:02:53.32","There. Now you're speaking in terms he can must surely identify with. You're not only equal. You dominate. Believe me, it's come to this. Take advantage of their weakness. They take advantage of yours. You're entitled."""
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:03:03.46"," The guys in the group all look at each other. Finally, Kara's boyfriend, Jeremy, says, ""There's nothing wrong with a guy looking at you and thinking how good you look."" Kara tells him that isn't the point."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Kara","00:03:14.32"," No. They say things. They'll follow you. They'll come up to you, and they'll talk to you like this. And they'll make sure that they do that, that their pelvis is pushing against you here."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Jeremy","00:03:23.51"," I have never, ever seen anybody do that, though."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Kara","00:03:25.08"," But you're not a woman, though."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:03:26.87"," Kara tells him a story about some guy who was staring at her in a pool hall."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Kara","00:03:31.06"," So when I was leaving, he went-- he came up real close to me. He's like, ""Bye."" I turned around, and I was like, ""I hate rude men!"" I screamed it, and then the entire pool hall was like-- and I was like--"
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Jeremy","00:03:44.32"," Man. You guys are rough. I'm never saying bye to a girl again in my life."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:03:51.28"," Mary's boyfriend, Aaron, has joined the conversation. ""So how should we treat girls?"" He asks. ""If we like a girl, how do we let her know without offending her?"""
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Aaron","00:03:58.58"," Right. That's why I'm asking how should we do it. And sometimes we don't know. And sometimes we don't know."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Mary","00:04:04.46"," Don't look at women like they're pieces of meat. Because they're not."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Aaron","00:04:06.42"," But what if they're dressed like that and want to be looked at like that? There's always that instinct in the guy. And if he sees something he really likes, he's going to look at it. If you would see a guy that you really like and really think is hot, you don't sit here--"
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Aaron","00:04:18.85","[INTERPOSING VOICES]"
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Aaron","00:04:20.01","Wait, wait, wait. Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. One, two, microphone check. Wait, listen. You're going to say, if a guy walks by that has a real nice butt that you like, you're not going to be like, damn."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:04:31.10"," They talk about this for 20 minutes. The boys ask over and over, what should we do? What do you want us to do? How should we act? And over and over, the girls name a few simple rules that anyone could follow if they pay attention. One, do not invade a girl's personal space. Two, don't say anything rude. Aaron says that certain things are only seen as rude if the girl doesn't like you. If she thinks you're cute, then they're OK."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Aaron","00:04:54.55"," Say if I was real-- if I was good looking, and I was sitting there staring at you, and if I was all--"
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Mary","00:05:00.03"," But I don't want to talk to a dork."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Aaron","00:05:01.55"," But how does he know that? If I was a dork, maybe I think I'm looking. What if we're just at the staring stage?"
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","subject","Mary","00:05:08.93"," No, no. Because if you don't know somebody, you've got to go by their--"
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:05:12.30"," What's striking is that there are certain moments when it actually seems like the boys really do want to know how they should act. They really want to know. And in those moments it's clear that this conversation could only happen in high school. After high school, everyone's opinion about these questions is pretty much set. But in high school, sometimes there's still a feeling that everything's up for grabs. So you can tell your boyfriend not to be a jerk, and he might actually listen."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:05:36.90","That's a good side of everything being up for grabs. There's also a bad side. With everything up for grabs, it's hard to know how you're supposed to act. Which brings us to today's program."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:05:49.49","Our program today is made up of three stories about teenage girls who have to decide how they're going to act in situations where the ground rules are unclear and very malleable. Act One of our program, Jo Carol Pierce bends the rules in a small town in Texas."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:06:03.82","Act Two, Chicago writer Rennie Sparks struggles without rules in suburban America, somewhere."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:06:09.39","Act Three, a man tries to lay down rules for a girl. Stay with us."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:06:18.14",""
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","host","Ira Glass","00:06:19.10"," Act One, Texas Girl."

"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","host","Ira Glass","00:06:42.50","And over the course of the record, she tells this funny, emotional story punctuated periodically by songs she's written. It's a version of American musical theater, one of the most American cultural forms. It's a kind of American musical theater that no one is bothering with, except for her. And it's the kind of CD that is not going to get much radio air play anywhere, and so we thought that we would begin today's show by playing you just a chunk of this record, a couple songs and some of the story."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","host","Ira Glass","00:07:13.53","And the story that she tells on the record begins with a suicide attempt, a teenager's suicide attempt. In real life, Jo Carol says that she thought about suicide well into her 30s, and she also worked at a suicide hotline. And the suicide on the record comes during a fight with her boyfriend."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","host","Jo Carol Pierce","00:07:31.67","Me and my boyfriend were driving around the loop, and we were having a terrible fight. I remember that he called me a son of a bitch. And that confused me, so I opened the passenger door and flung myself into traffic. First, I was hit by a pink Coupe de Ville, knocked me into the path of an out of state semi and just squished me flat into that burning asphalt."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","host","Jo Carol Pierce","00:07:55.26","But after I had committed suicide, I started seeing things in a whole new light. I noticed what a cute boy my boyfriend was. Couldn't understand why I'd been calling him a decorated rat only moments before my fatal plunge. I took his hand. It was chaffed and slightly smaller than mine. We went home, and I made him some biscuits and gravy from scratch, because I really wanted to."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","host","Jo Carol Pierce","00:08:23.98","It's good to commit suicide when there's something you just can't figure out. Like when I hit high school and I found out you're a bitch if you don't and a whore if you do. Commit suicide when you've got a burning question that no one can answer for you. Mine was, what are these boys for, and what am I supposed to do with them? Don't get upset about the war in the Middle East. Do something. Kill yourself."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","host","Jo Carol Pierce","00:08:47.83","It's good to commit suicide over small things that other people might neglect, like grocery shopping. I can't imagine walking into that ATB without first committing suicide. Think about it. Commit suicide first thing in the morning. And that way, you feel better all day. Do it your first day on a new job, and the next day you can call in dead. Do it early in a love affair and just get it over with."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","host","Jo Carol Pierce","00:09:12.68","That's why me and the boys are going to commit suicide right now. We hope that you will join us. Just start getting really pitiful and morose, and in the third verse, we will slit our wrists."

"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","host","Jo Carol Pierce","00:13:17.52","I got in a world of trouble going from Secret Dan to Secret Dan. I got a bad reputation in my peer group. Lots of my friends were getting married, and when they did, they would just drop me flat. And my friends that weren't real mad at me were real worried about me. And everybody was discouraging me from falling in love. They said, Jo Carol, why don't you do something you're good at?"
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","host","Jo Carol Pierce","00:13:40.30","So I tried to explain to them why I had to do these very upsetting things. I said, look, the reason that I cannot pass up a single Secret Dan is that each one of them is just another side of Jesus. And I know that because every time I kiss another one, I can feel Jesus right through his skin. And I need to know Jesus fully. Jesus in a brown leather jacket. Or the kind of thuggy Jesus with the hooded eyes like Robert Mitchum. Or the Jesus you want to make biscuits for. Or the Jesus you want to wrestle with. Or the Catholic Jesus. Or the Jesus who's so good in bed you think he's Catholic, but really he's not. There was even a Yankee Jesus."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","host","Jo Carol Pierce","00:14:22.77","And my friends said, nuh-uh. But I could tell my friends were upset by the truth, because they'd go off in small groups and whisper. And every once in a while I would hear this phrase, ""mental hospital."" And it made me nervous, so I got married. And when my husband slipped that golden wedding ring on my finger, it was the first time I'd ever strayed off of that spiritual path that Jesus had set out for me so specifically years before."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","host","Jo Carol Pierce","00:14:51.13","It was back in high school. One sunny night I was out jumping bar ditches in my parents' car when it overheated and stalled and left me stranded out there on the Idalou highway. I didn't know what I was going to do until this darling boy named Joey came along in his shiny truck, and he fixed my car on the spot. And then he witnessed to me about Jesus. It was his Highway Witness for Jesus Program."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","host","Jo Carol Pierce","00:15:18.47","And he was so darling that I just went to church with him that night. I liked sitting next to him so much, and before I knew what I was doing, I had grabbed his hand. He jerked and turned pale, but he did not get up and move. His heart was beating just like a hammer in the palm of his hand, and it was pounding home the sermon about the burning bush and the tongues of flame like never before. And I knew I had to keep that beat forever and ever."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","host","Jo Carol Pierce","00:15:49.08","And then we watched the preacher baptize Naomi [? Stutler. ?] And maybe it was the way her back arched when he pulled her up out of the water, or maybe it was the way that white robe clung to her body that inspired me to the point that I knew Jesus in my heart for the very first time, because he said something right in my ear. He said, ""Don't you ever even worry about keeping that beat. You just let that beat keep you."" I pretty much knew what was going to happen with the boys if I let that beat keep me, and I wasn't all that surprised that Jesus wanted me to go all the way. Because, after all, he did."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","host","Jo Carol Pierce","00:16:29.32","I took my first step on my new spiritual path that evening after church when I suggested to Joey that we park at a prairie dog camp and discuss Jesus a little further. Later on, Joey was real disappointed in himself for what happened out there, but I wasn't. My new spiritual path was just like walking on cloud nine."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","host","Jo Carol Pierce","00:16:49.95","I didn't hear from Joey for quite a while, but I didn't think anything about it. Because I had asked my question, what are these boys for, and what am I supposed to do with them in the plural. And it had been answered in the plural. And so I was real busy. But one evening Joey threw pebbles at my window, and I sneaked out behind the playhouse to meet him. And I found out why I had not heard from him was he had been saving up to buy me something very special."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","host","Jo Carol Pierce","00:17:15.34","But unfortunately, the day he got it out of layaway was the very--"
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","subject","Joey","00:17:18.51"," Jo Carol, I heard you drove through the [? Hidey-Ho ?] take-out window naked today after school."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","subject","Jo Carol Pierce","00:17:23.02"," Oh god, I am so relieved. I was afraid I had made that whole thing up in my head and was turning out to be crazy like Mama. Because, see, what happened was I drove up, Buddy [? Grays ?] gives me my change and my chili dog. And I just sit there waiting for something to happen. And finally I say, ""Buddy."" He says, ""What?"" He says, ""Hi."" He says, ""Hi."" And I drove off feeling like I wasn't even in this world. I am so relieved somebody besides me thinks that happened."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","subject","Joey","00:17:53.99"," How could you do this to me, Jo Carol?"
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","subject","Jo Carol Pierce","00:17:56.52"," Well, sometimes I get real bored."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","subject","Joey","00:17:58.63"," Well, if you're bored, there's plenty of constructive things you could do. You could raise a sheep or some chickens for the FFA. Or join the UFO Watch or go with me on the Highway Witness Program."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","subject","Jo Carol Pierce","00:18:07.50"," Now, wait, Joey. What did I ever do to you?"

"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","subject","Joey","00:18:17.02"," You ruined my life in my senior year."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","subject","Jo Carol Pierce","00:18:20.31"," Oh, Joey, I am just sick I ruined your senior year. But how did I do it exactly?"
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","subject","Joey","00:18:26.99"," I worked all my spare time to buy you this ring."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","subject","Jo Carol Pierce","00:18:30.19"," Oh, Joey, that is so pretty. Bless your heart, it really is."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","2","Act One. Texas Girl","subject","Joey","00:18:35.74"," It was my college education."

Any guy who thinks he ought to try and look good, even if he's a babe already, has got to be sort of sweet.

I try and give the blond one a look, but he's worse close up. His hair is long but hangs flat against the sides of his face, and his body is round and square like Barney Rubble. I feel myself rolling loose, bursting against my jeans, and I can see from his face that I'm just as unappealing to him. I manage a weak smile."

""I don't want to hang with him is all."" I press my index fingers to the corner of my eyes. The tips of my fingers are black with mascara and tears.

Her voice is thick, breathless. It's dark enough out that I just let my mascara run with a flood of tears. I know Dawn can see, but she just flips her hair and steps back away from me, talking loud so the guys can hear."

And behind the roar I hear him whispering, ""I love you. Yeah, I really love you, OK?"" Pushing me down to my knees, pushing my face into his zipper.

And lots of times when I thought maybe a guy might really like me. I know I'm supposed to go numb, just open my mouth and let it happen, and then wait for Dawn to call me to go home."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","3","Act Two. Suburban Girl","host","Rennie Sparks","00:45:22.87","But this time I can't seem to. This time there's no pretending that I'm doing it for Dawn or for myself or for any reason at all. Because this time I can see suddenly that Dawn is getting tired of me. Even if I play this right with Stevie, my days are numbered as her best friend."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","3","Act Two. Suburban Girl","host","Rennie Sparks","00:45:42.75","I open my eyes. After a moment, the gold thread along the zipper of his jeans appears. Tears are running into my mouth. My M up is shot. I try. I try so hard for Dawn, for my best friend. I try to keep my face pressed against his zipper, but I can't. And when his hand comes down and unbuttons his jeans, I pull away and stand up."

"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","3","Act Two. Suburban Girl","host","Rennie Sparks","00:46:16.10","I call for Dawn, but she still won't answer, so I turn and start back up toward the road. ""Hey,"" Stevie yells after me. ""You on the rag or something?"" ""I'm leaving, Dawn,"" I yell one last time. I know if I walk back to the mall, I'll be doing something awful. I know as soon as I step out of these woods, I won't have a best friend anymore."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","3","Act Two. Suburban Girl","host","Rennie Sparks","00:46:39.66","""Oh, get lost, fat girl,"" Stevie yells from behind me. Then after a moment he adds, ""It's your loss, OK?"" I start to run. I run up out of the woods and across the highway and through the lines of parked cars and into Macy's. I run through lingerie and pantyhose and piles of scarves. I run to the center of the mall where I stop, with a burning cramp squeezing my side, feeling my fat stomach covered in sweat under Dawn's borrowed sweater. I stand there panting, my face aching with dried tears. No one seems to notice me."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","3","Act Two. Suburban Girl","host","Rennie Sparks","00:47:18.49","The benches by the fountain are empty, and something tells me if I've lost Dawn, I've lost Gail and Carol, too. I've lost all the girls that sit at Dawn's lunch table at school. I'm all alone, and I have nowhere to sleep tonight."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","3","Act Two. Suburban Girl","host","Rennie Sparks","00:47:34.46","I go into Anthony's and buy three slices with pepperoni with the last of my money. I eat as fast as I can, with warm grease dripping down my neck. My throat burns with swallowing so fast."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","3","Act Two. Suburban Girl","host","Rennie Sparks","00:47:47.03","Inside the Sears bathroom there are two girls at the sink. I don't know them. One girl has her head back, and the other is French braiding her hair. Best friends. When they see me, one of them reaches up, turns on the hand dryer to shut me out."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","3","Act Two. Suburban Girl","host","Rennie Sparks","00:48:04.56","I go into a stall and lean over the bowl, one hand holding onto the toilet paper roll. The other hand turns into a knife. I stick it down into my throat until my stomach starts to shake and my mouth gags open, and the pizza rushes back up me and down, splashing into the bowl."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","3","Act Two. Suburban Girl","host","Rennie Sparks","00:48:23.52","The hand dryer clicks off. One of the girls says, ""Lisa should never wear yellow. Have you noticed that? She looks like a frog in yellow. It's weird."""
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","3","Act Two. Suburban Girl","host","Rennie Sparks","00:48:34.96","I lean against the wall of the stall, my head against the coat hook. My stomach feels thin and flat, empty. I let out a deep breath of air, and just for that one moment, between letting air out and filling myself up again, I feel beautiful, like a puzzle piece sliding in to fit. But then it's gone, and I flush the toilet and come out."

And showing me all his toys and junk and silly things that he had, and then proceeded to make the moves, make the big moves on me. And I was just very innocent. And he was very aggressive and just started kissing me and then just said, ""Take off your shirt."""
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","4","Act Three. Good Girl","host","Woman","00:52:45.67","And so I'm sitting there thinking, well, the door is unlocked. And he said, ""Well, you know--"" And he had a little sister who was pestering us."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","4","Act Three. Good Girl","host","Woman","00:52:57.91","So eventually I said, [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] And he's like, ""Oh, no."" And asks me do I want to see it. I did. And of course, I want to see it. I mean, I want to know what it looks like. But at the same time, I feel like I'm in this incredibly ominous-- this is a dangerous situation. It's pornographic.

More dirty than anything I've ever done since, even trying to be dirty. It was clinical, and I felt like I was being experimented upon. And the worst thing was that I was so passive. And I did what I was told, because I was a good girl. It was like a game to him."
"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","4","Act Three. Good Girl","host","Woman","00:54:38.81","Now that I'm older, now that I think about it, it was a game. It wasn't playful.

"24","Teenaged Girls","1996-05-24","4","Act Three. Good Girl","host","Woman","00:55:11.01","So here was this mindless thing. And he would look at me and think that I had been curious. ""Want to see it jump?"" So he could make it move. And flop around all by itself."
