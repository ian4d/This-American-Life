"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:36.19","Mr. Lewis is the kind of man who has a certain effect on people. And if you visit the school where he works, James McCosh Elementary, on Chicago's South Side, you can hear what that effect is."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:53.43","At Halloween, Mr. Lewis helps the kids convert the field house out on the school's parking lot into a two-room haunted house. It's a low-budget, handmade affair, but done so effectively that when the kindergarten, first grade, and second grade children walk in, they panic with the kind of panic that makes them drop things, that makes them scream and not stop screaming. They do not notice that the two monsters writhing on top of open graves are really just two sixth graders lying on top of barely disguised ping pong tables. They do not catch that the undead are wearing Nike cross trainers, or that sometimes, when the monsters flail about, yellow student IDs on neck chains come flopping out."

"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:39.58","This sixth grader extends her arms and sends a bunch of kids running in the other direction. The older kids play their parts with hilarious abandon, so happy they can't help grinning from ear to ear at moments when they're supposed to be scary."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","1","Prologue","subject","Mr. Lewis","00:01:51.78","Come on. [UNINTELLIGIBLE] Come on. They won't mess with you. Mr. Lewis is with you."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:57.67","Into the fray, in baseball cap and yellow jacket, walks Mr. Lewis. In theory, he's the school disciplinarian, but his reign is one of love more than fear. Three or four small children grip onto each of his hands, and he walks them past the ping pong table of terror, telling them he'd never let anything bad happen to any of them. Until, suddenly, they bolt for the door."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","1","Prologue","subject","Mr. Lewis","00:02:20.27","My group left me. Hey, come on, Mr. Lewis is here. That group went back out that door."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:29.55","He heads off for another group of kids to protect. The crowds thin after a while, and the girls on the ping pong table consent to an interview. One of them is holding forth on the thesis that, sure, a person could look at their outfits as striped referee jerseys, or you could choose to see them as pirate costumes. When the other girl volunteers, without any prompting, this--"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","1","Prologue","subject","Girl 1","00:02:49.30","Mr. Lewis is like a father to all of us at James McCosh School. He nice and he fun to be with."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","1","Prologue","subject","Girl 2","00:02:58.68","He makes us feel good. He been here for a long time. He knows most of our parents that went to this school and he just knows us."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","1","Prologue","subject","Girl 1","00:03:08.68","When we're sad, sometimes he makes us happy and stuff."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","1","Prologue","subject","Girl 2","00:03:10.63","When were frowning, he make us laugh."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","1","Prologue","subject","Girl 1","00:03:14.42","He funny. He like the jokester. He like to talk about people."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:03:18.73","They tell me about their favorite activities at McCosh, the Student Leaders of Tomorrow Club, the peer leadership workshops, cheerleading. Mr. Lewis is a big part of all these. It's Mr. Lewis who made the tombstones on their ping pong table that read, ""RIP, Cause of death: Gym."""
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:03:33.88","It's Mr. Lewis who mediates their fights. It's Mr. Lewis who really knows them."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:03:39.03","A month after I record this tape, a child is shot after school on the parking lot just outside this building. Just a few yards from the ping pong table these girls sit on. McCosh sits in a neighborhood that has all the problems of any inner city neighborhood, and it's easy to see why the students at McCosh need someone like Mr. Lewis so badly. And it's easy to imagine these girls, decades from now, remembering Mr. Lewis, talking about him, wondering what became of him. All of us have certain figures from our childhood who assume a kind of mythic status later when we remember them. Sometimes they're people who loved us. Sometimes they're more disturbing figures."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:04:17.82","Well, today, we've devoted much of our show to a story about a man who not only had one of these legendary figures in his childhood, he decided recently he was going to track down the legend, and along the way, stumbled into this kind of odd, epic story. It is a story of the Old South, the New South, Chihuahuas, high society manners, homosexuals, and some [UNINTELLIGIBLE] changes in American journalism. Stay with us won't you?"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:04:58.30","OK, I'm going to begin things with this song about respecting those who came before you and influenced you."

"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Ira Glass","00:07:32.80","Act one. So many stories about childhood are set at the first moment of adolescence, that moment when we first try to cope with the giddy, nauseating fact of what it's going to be like for us as adults. The sixth grade. This is where Jack Hitt's story and his search begin."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Ira Glass","00:07:53.56","A quick warning before we start. Parts of this story might not be suitable for younger listeners."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:07:59.61","Most people have a funny little story about finding out where babies come from. I've got one."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:08:05.08","My friend Parker Coleman told me about it. We were playing in his backyard at this particular time and place. That being 1967 in Charleston, South Carolina. Until then, I knew about the sex act only from cuss words. In my mind, it was earthy, nasty, certainly forbidden. From the air, I had picked up the idea that sex was something black folks did. Maybe whites without the right breeding. Proper people did not really have sex. A youthful impression that I've since learned is true. But when Parker told me that babies and sex were connected my sister Diane was pregnant for the first time. So I punched him in the face, hopped on my bicycle, and sped on home."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:08:46.31","But this rather standard tale of sexual awakening occurs within a larger story. For me, a much larger story. See, in my neighborhood, we lived down the street from a British writer named Gordon Langley Hall. A slim man who preferred bow ties. I remember hearing one day that Gordon had left for a distant hospital-- Johns Hopkins-- and returned fully reconstituted as a woman who now preferred to be known as Dawn Pepita Langley Hall."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:09:15.61","My new neighbor favored Jackie Kennedy dresses and pillbox hats. Her hair was grown out until it curled at the collar in the fashion of that time. She wore lipstick. A modest '60s bosom appeared. Not long after her operations, she announced her engagement to a handsome shrimper named John-Paul Simmons. John-Paul also worked as Dawn's butler, and John-Paul was also black."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:09:40.66","I remember hearing that Dawn's adopted mother, the British film actress Dame Margaret Rutherford, was quoted to the effect that she didn't mind Gordon changing his sex, or Gordon marrying a man of another race, or Gordon marrying into a lower station. But she did wish that the young man was not Baptist. Such anecdotes never seemed to cease, especially after Dawn announced that she was pregnant by John-Paul. I can remember seeing her a lot during this period, walking down the street, heavy with child. Everyone said it was a pillow under her dress. The town began to freak, and properly did so when she returned from the secret birthing-- it was in England-- with a beautiful mulatto baby."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:10:22.98","Well, that was the last straw for Charleston. Unseen pressures were applied and one day I heard that the house was sold. Almost overnight Dawn disappeared, and almost as quickly, became a bizarre Gothic yarn I told to stunned audiences."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:10:38.74","But over the years, even I no longer believed the story and just quit telling it. Eventually, one ceased to hear about Dawn at all."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:10:49.04","Now around the time she announced her marriage, I remember being sent to my brother's room. Bobby, who was 17, was given the task of setting me straight on the facts of life. Given what was going on down the street, Bobby had a lot of ground to cover."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:11:02.21","I remember he confirmed Parker Coleman's story. Then by way of bridging his material to Dawn, he told me what homosexuals were and what they did. Then he told me about transsexuals with complete details on cutting up the penis and surgically fashioning a vagina. I was 10."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:11:19.90","Part of what I remember of that era is that the media arrived every time there was a new outrage in the ongoing Dawn saga and that the story went national many times over the next few years. I can remember sneaking down to that house, trying to catch a peep of anything through the wrought iron gates. Dawn. She became my own Boo Radley, a sexual parable, a Zen koan of the bizarre. For me, the mystery of sex still has an overwrought tabloid grandeur to it."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:11:50.00","Almost three decades have passed, and like I said, I've come to doubt the entire Dawn epic cycle. I knew there had to be some truth to it, but I also know that childhood memory is a net, snagging and shaping every little fact and rumor into the stuff of symbolic language. I assume that there is a little nugget of truth in Dawn, and I wanted to find out what it was. So I ran back to mom. She has lived in Charleston all her life."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:12:16.57","We poured some iced tea one afternoon and sat at her dining room table."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","interviewer","Jack Hitt","00:12:20.11","When Gordon was still a guy--"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Jack's Mom","00:12:23.39","Can you say that?"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","interviewer","Jack Hitt","00:12:24.65","Yeah, I can say that."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Jack's Mom","00:12:25.42","OK."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:12:26.03","That's my mom whispering. You can't really hear her. What's she saying is, ""Can you say that on the radio?"" Here, listen again."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","interviewer","Jack Hitt","00:12:32.89","When Gordon was still a guy--"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Jack's Mom","00:12:35.93","Can you say that?"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","interviewer","Jack Hitt","00:12:37.58","Yeah, I can say that. When Gordon was still a guy--"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Unspecified","00:12:42.60","You see, good Charlestonians do not discuss private affairs openly. If at all, we discuss them sotto voce, sometimes literally in a whisper. This impulse is compounded by the fact that Dawn's story is so over the top that my mom can't really talk about it, even still. Dawn can not be considered seriously. Dawn can not even be considered. The very question is preposterous."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Jack's Mom","00:13:06.33","No, I never really had anything to do with him at all."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","interviewer","Jack Hitt","00:13:09.95","We never had him over for dinner."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Jack's Mom","00:13:11.46","Are you kidding? I didn't even hardly speak to him. My goodness, Jack."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","interviewer","Jack Hitt","00:13:19.04","I'm sorry, Mom."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Unspecified","00:13:20.07","I can't get Mom to really remember much about Dawn. As we talk, she whispered to me a number of times that she really has nothing to say, would rather not talk about it, and would prefer I turn off the tape recorder. So I tried to change the subject to the neighborhood we shared with Dawn because it's part of the story."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Unspecified","00:13:36.17","In the mid '60s, Daddy had moved the family out of the historic part of downtown Charleston, a white neighborhood, into an uptown slum called Ansonborough, predominately black. The few whites in the area were mainly homosexuals who had moved there, as we did, to buy an antebellum home for cheap and fix it up."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Unspecified","00:13:53.85","In this context, Gordon was just one of what was known as the ""confirmed bachelors"" in the 'hood."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Jack's Mom","00:13:59.43","He seemed to be very [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. He'd written a couple of things that, whether anybody read them or not, I don't know. But they were written up nicely in the papers. And the people mostly that entertained him were-- he did socialize a little bit with some writers and all. And a few of the dowagers, so to speak, really had him for entertainment value, and they liked him. And then of course, later when they found out about him, they didn't. They cut him off fast."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Jack's Mom","00:14:30.77","But he was a kind of a semi-sensation for a while around Charleston."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","interviewer","Jack Hitt","00:14:35.79","Now what made him sensational? Was it that he was a writer, or that he was flamboyant, or what?"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Jack's Mom","00:14:39.98","No, he was very different. And then he had--"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","interviewer","Jack Hitt","00:14:42.73","I mean, did people understand that he was possibly a homosexual?"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Jack's Mom","00:14:46.09","No. No, I don't think they-- this was the beginning of a lot of people like that coming to Charleston. And a lot of them have added a lot to Charleston."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:14:56.00","After 45 minutes of tea drinking and considering the cultural contributions of homosexuals, mom did remember one story. It was not about race, or class, or genitals, or sex. But like every Dawn account, it was Gothic, almost supernatural. It concerned Dawn's restored mansion."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Jack's Mom","00:15:13.39","When a friend of your sister's bought the house it was so horrible inside."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","interviewer","Jack Hitt","00:15:21.98","Like what?"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Jack's Mom","00:15:23.93","Just pretty bad."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","interviewer","Jack Hitt","00:15:24.79","In what way?"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Jack's Mom","00:15:25.69","All of the floors had to be re-sanded and everything. It had animals in there. They had kept a pig in there. That type of thing. Just filthy. Just filthy."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","interviewer","Jack Hitt","00:15:33.64","He kept a pig in there?"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Jack's Mom","00:15:34.70","Well, he kept some kind of animals. Yeah, there was a pig in there. And there was all kind of animals. Just everything had to be sanded and scoured, and all like that."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:15:44.48","That's right, a pig. See, that's how Dawn's stories kind of go. Anyway, Mom did suddenly recall one important detail of Dawn the person."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Jack's Mom","00:15:52.94","He had piercing brown eyes. I remember, he would look at you, and it would kind of almost be scary, I thought."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:16:00.53","For you Yankees who have never heard a pure Charleston accent, that's piercing brown eyes. I remember their haunting quality too. And as I talked to people in town, both on and off the radio, it was all they remembered of Dawn, the person."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:16:14.09","Otherwise, the tales sounded like an emerging mythology. Cloven-hooved animals, Medusa-like stare. Dawn, a Charleston legend."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:16:35.13","For most of my adult life, especially as I became a reporter, I have also seen the story cycle as a parable of modern journalism, the last stand of an old fashioned media that struggled not to let scandalous claims dictate the headlines."

"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:17:09.29","My father died before the wedding. But even afterwards, the local coverage was subdued. Dawn's wedding announcement appeared as a filler on the obituary page."

"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:17:36.22","In another edition, there is a first person account of the wedding. Here, let me read it. ""Dawn Pepita Hall, a British born male before a sex change operation last October, changed her name tonight, marrying her former butler, a negro. Wearing a full-length white gown with a 12 foot train, the thin, brown-haired Miss Hall entered the wedding room in her restored Charleston mansion to the strains of ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" and was married to John-Paul Simmons, 30. 25 guests and a handful of newsmen witnessed the 20-minute ceremony, performed by the Reverend William Singleton, a negro who appeared ill at ease."""

He knew the proper people in New York, and he had written a book, and he had an English accent. And that was enough to make him the darling of Charleston society for a while. Until they found out he was a homosexual, then they dropped him. Because at that time, being a homosexual wasn't exactly proper in Charleston. At that time."

There was a TV station there. And when the bridal party came down the stairs to the tune of ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic,"" which I thought was the beginning of a farce at the moment."

We've got to see the wall, because the other thing is that wall-- Jack, when I think about it, that wall was like 18 feet high. There's monkey blood in you, young'un. There has got to be to scale those walls, because the banana trees were like 20 feet tall. We took the house-- rather I took it, Edward took it just because he trusted me. And I said, it's like the dawn of creations of [? Astier's ?] garden. You'll only know that when you hit the back. But as I say, to scale that wall would have been a feat, I think. Even for nine years old, you were then?"

A well known orchestra, of course, who played-- who knows? A combination of rap, Japanese, pipe, avant garde music and Charleston spirituals. I have no earthly idea. But anyway, it was on that porch on the other side of the garden. And that's where the main wedding was."

The dog story would come up from time to time and always slightly different. In one account I heard it was a wedding. In another it was Great Danes that were given a debutante party. But as I moved among the different subcultures of Charleston, these stories provided me with another insight into Dawn. She was a scandal not only for straight Charlestonians, but for the gay aristocracy as well, two groups who were often hard to distinguish in those days."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Jay","00:26:58.64","The whole thing was you had to be married. So this group I'm talking about who were gay were all married men.

I think they were off about 30 or 40 minutes. We talked the other day. We didn't know because we got candles and things and barricaded the door.

The image I had was of a mansion, like in Charleston. But it turns out her house is near the train station, a vacant street with neglected warehouses. Even in the morning, a bar down the way was open. At her door, the brown paint was peeled and cracked. In the foyer it felt dank. The walls were missing chunks of plaster. A dead vacuum cleaner appeared chucked on a heap of trash."

She was small, dressed in a red smock and purple leggings. Her grey hair was dyed red. It had three inches of white roots. She looked like an old lady, complete with dowager's hump. And then there were those piercing brown eyes that had not changed in 30 years. Friend or foe, they queried."

Although I did not see him again, John-Paul's presence never left the room."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:35:32.36","Dawn apologized for a hump, which was actually a stoop. She slumped in a chair to get comfortable, adjusted her dress, and began at the beginning."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Dawn Langley Simmons","00:35:42.69","I was born in a country village in England with a country midwife. And when I was born, the clitoris was so small they couldn't tell if I was a little baby boy or a little girl. And the law in England was at that time-- it was a very cruel law, which incidentally was changed through my case. The law in England at that time was that, when in doubt, the child is just automatically registered as a boy, with dire results."

Dawn","interviewer","Jack Hitt","00:36:48.45","Then she told me that she grew up with her father, who was, in her words, the factotum and chauffeur at writer Vita Sackville-West's famous estate known as Sissinghurst.

He was investigating the role that the mafia had played in the drug trafficking. They used the inland waterways and so forth, and the lonely plantations and so forth.

He broke my nose. He crippled this arm, which has never been-- I've been able to use it properly since. And broke my big toe, beating me up. And it was a rape thing.

Both of us had amazing stories to tell. Lisa is a med student. And she told me that in the hospital that very day she had assisted with an operation on a newborn girl. The affliction is called virilization, and the symptoms are an adrenal abnormality that causes the clitoris to expand to the size of the tip of your thumb and look like a penis.

It's quite a list of contessas and various countesses and so forth."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","interviewer","Jack Hitt","00:45:11.42","You know, when I was reading that I kept thinking, it felt like a Dickens novel."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Dawn Langley Simmons","00:45:16.29","Absolutely."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","interviewer","Jack Hitt","00:45:18.23","I kept expecting at some point, someone's going to come along and discover who Dawn is."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Dawn Langley Simmons","00:45:23.11","Yeah, absolutely."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","interviewer","Jack Hitt","00:45:23.80","And everything will be OK. Is that what's happened?"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Dawn Langley Simmons","00:45:27.36","This came out with-- another fellow author in England wrote and said, I always knew you came from good stock. And it was one of those things. It has been a long road. Everything has just gone full circle."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","subject","Dawn Langley Simmons","00:45:49.67","I've done the mansion bit. I've done the debutante bit. I've been everything. Now, give me a little peace. Let me be me."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:46:03.33","Violating any boundary is always difficult. But typically when one does cross forbidden lines-- interracial or interreligious marriage, or announcing that one is gay, or changing one's sex-- at least there is a community waiting for you on the other side. But Dawn has crossed so many borders at once that she has slipped into a country where she is the only citizen. She is poor, her husband is schizophrenic, her life is fairly harsh, her books overcompensatingly sentimental. She speaks a unique language, a kind of Gothic romance."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:46:39.61","Even as I sat in her living room-- slightly aromatic from her dogs, her once beautiful antiques aged into ruin-- it was difficult not to feel a real respect for her for roughing it out. No one pressured her into the life she chose. She dwells in her own private Charleston. Now a bona fide dowager, ready to serve tea, hospitable, even brave, but alone."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:47:05.52","When I asked her at the end of our interview if she remembered a little red-headed boy who stared into her gates, she allowed that she did. She said she had quite fond memories of the family down the street. She chose not to mention the obvious, that my father refused to publish her story in the local paper. Instead, like a true Charlestonian, she behaved as if she had stumbled upon an old acquaintance and was simply delighted to be back in touch."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:47:30.96","Then, as every Charlestonian I know, including myself, would do, she changed the subject to something more comfortable."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:47:39.45","A few days later, I received another note that began--"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","2","Act One. Dawn","host","Jack Hitt","00:47:43.03","""Dear Jack, as you are my red-haired boy at the gate, I think I should call you Jack and not Mr. Hitt."" She said that she had bought her new house, a modest two-story place on Hudson's Main Street. It has some age to it, and she hopes to fix it up. As is the custom in England, she wants to give the house a name. She's pretty much set on using the title of a book by her old mentor, Vita Sackville-West. She wants to call her new house All Passion Spent question mark. She invites me to come visit. And then the letter ends casually, ""Yours sincerely, Dawn."""

Well, up until this point in our program, you've been listening to a story that first aired on our show two and a half years ago. Since then, a lot has happened. Dawn, incredibly, has moved back to Charleston at the urging of her daughter. She now lives in an otherwise all black neighborhood in a rundown old house. She meets with old women, basically has managed to get the life that she wanted as a dowager in Charleston."

"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","subject","Jack Hitt","00:50:42.98","Often a letter, but more often than not, it's an envelope containing clips from the local newspaper that are, in some way, indicative of subjects that she thinks she and I share."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:50:56.11","Like what kind of thing?"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","subject","Jack Hitt","00:50:57.82","They often have almost metaphysical significance. For example, one story was about finding some sunken treasure just outside the harbor. And I couldn't quite figure out what the meaning of it was until I suddenly just sort of stared at the headline where it said, ""Old Charleston Continues to Yield its Secrets."" And it just suddenly dawned on me that maybe that was the only reason she sent me the piece--"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:51:30.14","Wow."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","subject","Jack Hitt","00:51:30.91","--was that headline."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:51:31.73","It's like each one is like a little hieroglyph."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","subject","Jack Hitt","00:51:33.94","Right. They're rather cryptic. I sometimes don't quite understand why I'm getting them. But anyway, Dawn and I very much stayed in contact. We've seen each other a bunch of times since then. I've met her daughter. I've met her two grandchildren."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:51:47.88","When you followed your story for us, when you did you story for us two and a half years ago, when the story ended, you weren't exactly sure what to believe about her story. And since then, with all this contact with her and meeting her family and spending more time with her, you actually now know what you believe to be the truth."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","subject","Jack Hitt","00:52:03.74","Well, I do. I do believe that she was born a woman with a defect. You know, when I first interviewed her for the program, when I came home, you remember, my wife had just participated in this odd little surgery at the local hospital for this problem called virilization. And subsequent reporting with a pediatrician named Anjali Jain, taught me that this condition is called hyperplasia. And that, in fact, it's common enough that every child at birth in this country is screened for it now."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","subject","Jack Hitt","00:52:46.52","Her description of what she went through, every detail, the sort of biannual menses and lack of breast development and all the various afflictions she talks about through her adolescence and into her adulthood were described exactly that way by Dr. Jain when I interviewed her."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","subject","Jack Hitt","00:53:13.67","Plus the fact I interviewed her daughter at length. I found when Dawn moved back to Charleston, the daughter was there. She's working two jobs. And I just asked her outright. There are people who think that your mother is not a woman. And she explained that she knew in a way that a daughter would know that she was a woman."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:53:38.45","Well, she said she took care of her, right?"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","subject","Jack Hitt","00:53:39.64","She takes care of her, yeah. I mean, Dawn has had a rough time physically for decades. And the daughter has taken care of her in the way that a nurse would take care of her."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:53:49.06","One of the things that you mentioned in the story is this story that Dawn tells about an attempt on her life and Albert Goldman. And in your original story two and a half years ago, you sort of presented it as like look at all the tales around this woman. Do you have an opinion now about whether, in fact, those things happened?"
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","subject","Jack Hitt","00:54:10.17","To listen to Dawn tell a story, I mean I think she mythologizes herself as much as we did. But to a different end. I mean, I was amazed that every story she had to tell had very similar themes to them, of a lost aristocrat being denied her due. And in some way, she is, in real life-- I mean in her childhood, she was the illegitimate offspring of Vita Sackville-West's chauffeur. He is shunned by all of these people. She always sees herself as being kept out of her real life, of the life that she was supposed to have lived. And it's true. And those themes never escape her telling of almost any story."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","subject","Jack Hitt","00:55:01.91","And so when she tells a story of someone breaking into her house and trying to harm her, and beating her, or whatever, I think there is a core of truth to these stories. But I think it's very complicated. I think she has a narrative way of telling her stories that make them seem, I think, preposterous to many people."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:55:23.53","And that gets to one of the things about this story, which is so tragic. There are the stories that we tell ourselves about who we are and then there are the stories that other people say about who we are. And if those two things don't match up in large part, you're in for trouble. And that's what happened to her. The story that she believed about herself was so radically different from the story that the world believed about her."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","subject","Jack Hitt","00:55:52.48","Right. And realize that the world, from the very beginning, was forcing her to live a myth that she was a man. When, in fact, on some level she was a woman."

"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two. Dawn Again","subject","Jack Hitt","00:56:26.99","And McCullers comes to Charleston at some point in the early '60s, when Gordon was still very much a guy. And Gordon, at that point, is a well known novelist and has Carson McCullers in for dinner. This is right down the street. This is when I'm 10 years old. And so Carson is an older person at that point, and at the end of the party-- hasn't said much the entire evening, but at the end of the party asks Gordon to come sit in a chair in the corner of the room. And they talk very briefly."
"15","Dawn","1996-02-28","3","Act Two.
