I think you'd lose your job, and I would hope you would lose your job. But I just objected to that. And I would never do it."

The Undiscovered Country","subject","Luanne Johnson","00:01:43.95","No, that's one of the reasons I wrote that book, is I felt like people were just writing off kids. You know, 13, 14 years old, saying, well, they're hopeless, they're useless, and there's nothing we can do. All the things I was reading were about how horrible they are, and they have no respect for people, and they don't care, and they're unteachable. And I just don't feel that's true. I think that's really wrong."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","host","Ira Glass","00:02:11.02","Well, LuAnne Johnson's deal with the devil proceeded in several stages. First the film, which starred Michelle Pfeiffer, came out, I don't know, two years ago I think, three years ago. And LuAnne Johnson did like some things about the film."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Luanne Johnson","00:02:23.37","The primary lesson I always try to teach my students is you choose who you are. You can throw up your hands and blame everyone in the world and say, I can't earn an A, I can't do this, I have to do that. You don't have to do anything. You don't have to come to school. You choose to be here. Now you can choose to learn, or you can choose to vegetate. I think that came across in the movie, that there is hope, that you're not a victim."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Student 1","00:02:43.42","Man, you don't understand nothing. I mean, you don't come from where we live. You're not bussed here."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Michelle Pfeiffer","00:02:48.25","Do you have a choice to get on that bus?"
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Student 1","00:02:50.60","Man, you come and live in my neighborhood for one week, and then you tell me if you've got a choice."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Michelle Pfeiffer","00:02:55.26","There are a lot of people who live in your neighborhood who choose not to get on that bus. The people who choose to get on that bus, which are you, are the people who are saying I will not carry myself down to die. When I go to my grave, my head will be high. That is a choice. There are no victims in this classroom."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","host","Ira Glass","00:03:17.07","But the movie took some liberties with LuAnne Johnson's book. For instance, the filmmakers made her mixed race class into an all minority class. The filmmakers invented fictional black parents who did not want their kids to learn. The filmmakers organized the film around two stories which did not happen in real life. In one, LuAnne Johnson gets so overwhelmed by how impossible it is to make progress with her kids that after just a few months, she decides to quit. And in the other, a student is shot and killed. And she feels that these things reinforce the very stereotypes that she was trying to dispel by writing her book in the first place."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Luanne Johnson","00:03:54.70","And I think the movie really promotes racial tension by constantly pitting black against white, having the kids call me ""white bread,"" which never happened. It just, it didn't happen."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Luanne Johnson","00:04:04.86","And I said to them, why'd they do that? And they said, well, we found it hard to believe that a classroom of black and Hispanic kids would welcome a white teacher and give her any respect. And I said, but it's not a matter of your skin color, it's a matter of how you treat them. But they couldn't believe that. And they still don't. And I think there are a lot of people who do believe that you can't walk into a classroom filled with minority kids and they're going to treat you right."

"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Luanne Johnson","00:05:14.01","Someone called me and said, did you hear? I heard they're making a TV show out of your book. And I said, oh really? Oh, that's interesting. So I called my agent in Los Angeles and said, ""They're making a TV series? I would like to consult, because I don't want them to do what they did with the movie, get so far removed from reality. I'd really like to have something to do this time."""
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Luanne Johnson","00:05:33.86","So she called back later and said, ""No, they said they don't need you. They don't want you. They can't afford you."" And I said, ""What do you mean? I know I'm a lot cheaper than those Hollywood people."" So, call them back."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:05:44.70","That's right. Apparently they haven't heard about educational salaries in America."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Luanne Johnson","00:05:49.24","Right. And then there was some discussion between her and them and me. And in fact, I asked one of the producers how much they're paying the writers. I said, ""I heard you were paying them $50,000 each per episode."" And he said, ""Oh no, we're only paying them $30,000 plus perks."""
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:06:01.32","Per episode?"
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Luanne Johnson","00:06:01.94","A week. And we asked them to pay $25,000 for a year. And they said, ""Well, we'll see. Probably not."""
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","host","Ira Glass","00:06:17.64","Again, there are things about the TV series that LuAnne Johnson likes. She likes, especially, the feisty, in-your-face way that Annie Potts plays her, for example. But she also finds plenty that makes her uncomfortable. Like that episode where the students stage the fundraiser in the strip club. They hold something called a hair war."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Annie Potts","00:06:35.44","What? What is a hair war?"
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Student 2","00:06:37.81","It's kind of like a fashion show, only with hairdos."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Annie Potts","00:06:39.43","You're trying to tell me that people will come and lay down good money to watch us get our hair curled?"

"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two.

And I said, ""Where do I start? Would you like if your 14-year-old or 15-year-old daughter came home from school and you found out her teacher had taken her to a strip club?"" And he didn't answer that."

"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Luanne Johnson","00:07:21.61","They did the hair war to raise funds because Ms. Johnson had a fight with a school board member who it turns out is taking money away from the program. For a teacher to involve kids in a political fight like that among the adults is inappropriate. It's just not professional behavior. And I wouldn't do such a thing. It's undignified, and it's silly. And he said, ""Well, I think it's cute."" And I said, ""Well, I'll tell you what, I'm not cute, and my students don't think I am."""

"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Andy Schneider","00:09:20.75","--silly. And our feeling is, well, that might be the case. But in terms of creating a story, and an arc in the story, and giving a satisfying conclusion, it really helped the story to have her participate in it. And we felt as writers that that was endearing, and something that was positive and really lovable about her, that she would participate in the competition."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","host","Ira Glass","00:09:44.69","The real LuAnne Johnson also had problems with a scene in an early program where a black character threatens to kill the TV Ms. Johnson because she's encouraging his girlfriend to go to college."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Luanne Johnson","00:09:53.52","And I said, this is so wrong. There are black males who aren't trying to kill people. Why do you have to constantly present them as violent? They can drop out of school even and still not be a criminal."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Luanne Johnson","00:10:03.58","And I really resent that, because nobody ever threatened me.

"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","host","Ira Glass","00:10:14.98","Producers Andy Schneider and Diane Frolov say that, although LuAnne Johnson herself was never threatened, other teachers in her situation certainly have been.

"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","2","Act Two. The Undiscovered Country","subject","Diane Frolov","00:10:29.09","The conflict was not so much about the fact that she was going to college but that he was losing control of her."

I remember driving her back from orchestra rehearsal and sitting with her in my car outside her house. I was 16 and she was 14. I remember her telling me about the problems in her family back home in Korea. Her father was having financial difficulties. Her brother was having trouble getting into the right college, which in Korea determines your whole future. And her sister had had some kind of breakdown and had been put into a mental institution."

But what I remember best was that these crises somehow forced Jayna to think about her decision to come to America in a new way.

I remember her telling me that she felt she could never go back to Korea, that she had missed too much."

I'm not one of them. So I really just kind of felt like I didn't belong anywhere. And that's when I slept a lot."

I was going to bookstores, looking for-- I don't know. I was reading, just trying to look for what interests me. I was just like wanting-- I don't know. I was dwelling on that luxury of being able to choose for myself. But eventually, I really missed it. I really missed the music."

"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","4","Act Four. Carmen Becomes Faust","host","Alix Spiegel","00:36:13.11","Jayna's story reminds me of that. She agrees that yes, she made a Faustian bargain. She left her family, left her country, left her home. But she never got the fame and fortune she made all those sacrifices for. And when I talked to her, I somehow expected her to be as conflicted about it as she was when we were in my car at 16. But in fact, she was fine with it. Her feelings have changed, and she's outgrown the premise of the bargain. She doesn't particularly want to be a soloist, and she's not driven for fame."

When the man who ran the flea market invited me out to dinner at the Steak 'n Egg Kitchen, I was flabbergasted. I was, but I went anyway."

I drove back to the country $20 poorer and kind of depressed that I could have been so vulnerable."

On Sunday, I poured the bottle of Chinese floor wash into the bucket of fresh pumped water and scrubbed all the floors in the house with it. This was to clear out evil spirits. Then when the children went to sleep, I began the ritual of the spirit bath. I placed the candles around the galvanized tin tub that we used for everything, filled it with kettles of hot water, and poured in the first bottle of red liquid from the box I bought."

First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:41:53.71","Just before I got in the tub, I arranged the white roses in front of my dead mother's picture. This was to ensure her blessing and ask her to intervene on my behalf. As soon as I got in the water, I got this weird, tingly feeling. The shadows from the candles loomed around me like ghosts, and the water looked like blood."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:42:10.86","I sat there naked and shivering by the wood stove and prayed out loud for God to send me things I associated with red. I asked for sex, adventure, and central heat. I also asked for red cowboy boots and a ruby ring. On Monday morning, I drove to Culpepper and found the cowboy boots for $2 at the Pink Ladies Shop and the ring in a jar of buttons which they let me have for $0.25. That night, the awful man from the flea market drove out to see me and spent the night."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:42:40.05","I realized my next wishes would have to be more specific. Tuesday evening, I repeated the ritual, except the water turned blue. I found it a harder color to match with things I needed, so I just asked for general good fortune. Nothing special happened Wednesday, but nothing went wrong either."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:42:57.62","Well, it went on like that for the next 14 days. My luck began to turn. I found better clothes in the thrift shops than I'd ever found before, and made over $100 at the flea market. My landlord began to smile and wave at me when I drove past his house, and letters with small checks in them arrived at the post office. But I guess I have to get to the unbelievable part, and here's what it is. A handsome young millionaire came up to me the last day of the baths and offered me free rent in a sunny slum apartment, and $10,000 to start my own business. Sounds like a lie, doesn't it? I know it does, but it's true."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:43:34.38","Soon after we moved there, he fell in love with me, and we all lived together that winter, sleeping on mattresses on the floor and eating Chinese food out of cardboard containers. That was one of the happiest times in my life, though I missed certain things about living alone in the country. The dark side of the magic hadn't revealed itself yet, so we blithely enjoyed our warm rooms, and I thanked Jesus every night for his blessings."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:44:02.31","I've heard that we punish ourselves better and more profoundly than any spirits or gods we can imagine. I hope that's true. I hope that's true because I still feel guilty. Because, you see, David, the millionaire, was married, and I knew it from the very beginning. He invited me to Washington, DC to have dinner with him and his wife."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:44:25.09","I remember everything about that night. I wore an antique dress, platform shoes, and three carved Bakelite bracelets. My entire outfit cost less than $10. His wife had a mink coat, and long, red fingernails. I was very impressed with them both. They'd invited me to drive from my little house in Virginia to discuss a business deal. He was a slum landlord. She had an antique clothing store. They had discovered me selling things at the Georgetown flea market and wanted me to trade clothes for a three-room apartment in a tenement across town. It seemed like a good idea to me at the time."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:45:06.47","So I took the place. But things didn't really go as they were intended to. The apartment was cramped and lonely. All the other tenants were on strike because the building was falling down. And David, the owner, wanted me to be his mistress. During this time, my visits to the local Haitian voodoo store became more frequent."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:45:28.29","You must understand that living in the ghetto was very different from living in any other part of town. Even the grocery stores sell statues of Santa Barbara, San Lazaro, and the Virgin Mary. And when one of the neighbors was found dead on the front stoop, the Jamaican woman whose son dressed like a ninja and practiced swinging his nunchucks in the hall put holy candles all around the lobby in the order of the seven African powers."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:45:52.89","We were the only white family on the block. It was very lonely. My only comfort was sitting in the cool, spooky Catholic church looking at the handmade doll clothes the ladies made for the statues."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:46:10.33","And then, one full moon, I put on my black velvet dress pinned with a rhinestone dagger, wrapped a small box of jinx remover powder in a white handkerchief, and walked across town to the house where David and his wife lived. It was not really clear to me at the time what I was up to. I felt as if I was being guided by an unseen force, but I swear, I had no real idea what I was doing. I took a pine branch and I put it through the mail slot. And then I left this little package on the stoop, said a few magic words, and ran."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:46:44.32","The next morning, when David came out to get the paper, he found the stick and the spell. His wife asked him to go buy half and half for their coffee because they were having weekend guests. David says he doesn't really know why he decided to go to the little tienda by my house, but when he got there, he decided to come see me. Until that moment, neither one of us had felt anything for the other."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:47:08.40","When I opened the door, he was standing there crying. He said he loved me and couldn't live without me. I said the same thing, and he never went back home. His wife sued him for $1 million, all the furniture, and the Mercedes. She won, but I got him. It took me years to figure out how to get away."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:47:40.96","It's true that I loved him for a while, or at least I thought I did. But looking back on it, I realize I had been alone so long that I would have probably thought I was in love with anybody who took care of me. I remember when he bought me this Diana Ross song, ""I Know I'll Never Love This Way Again."" I'd play that before he came over and dance around the house and try to get in the mood."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:48:03.27","Then my brother was found half-dead of a barbiturate overdose in the woods of West Virginia on a commune, and he came to live with us. Four people in a three-room apartment. One thing led to another, and David took us all under his wing. Michael tried to kill himself two more times. Christmas came and went. David gave me $40 a week and took me out to dinner, which sometimes cost three times that."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:48:29.75","I felt like I was El Salvador and David was America. I used to scream and cry and beg him to let me go. One of the neighbors put it into words very well when he carved ""landlord's whore"" on my front door. I refused to let David have it painted over. It was true. There are only two kinds of frenzy that take all my reason away. One is the frenzy of love, one is the frenzy of needing money. It got to the point where I was in a constant frenzy. I needed a lawyer and a psychiatrist."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:49:04.79","My cripple brother moved across the street to another hot slum apartment and lived with a black woman named May. They fought over money, other men, his leaving his clothes on the floor for her to pick up, et cetera. She was very beautiful, like Diana Ross, but she stayed drunk on straight gin and watched soap operas all day. David gave him $200 a week to live on. It was part of our understanding even though we never discussed it."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:49:35.06","I knew that my staying with him kept my brother from another suicide attempt. The money gave us all a false sense of security, but the thought of it being taken away haunted us constantly. I was 30 years old. The children were eight and four. My brother was 24. And David was 33 and already a millionaire."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:49:56.48","Then one hot night in June, I began to break all the windows in the apartment with my bare hands. I began to scream out the window that this is what happened to a woman when she had to sell her body to pay the rent. David tried to hold me down and cover my mouth, but I broke away and ran down three flights of stairs screaming."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:50:12.55","When I got out on the cement steps, he and his brother caught me again. But before they realized what was happening, I ripped my dress in two and stood there naked and yelling, ""Take it, take it. This is all you want. This is what you pay for, my body, not me, just this body."" His brother slapped me in the face and they drug me naked up the cement stairs, scraping the skin off my back."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:50:34.08","I don't remember too much after that, but nothing really changed. We went on living there. My brother went on living across the street. Two years later, he finally did kill himself by jumping out the window. I kept his remains in the kitchen cabinet for a long time."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:51:00.86","But it took me seven years to get rid of David. Ronald Reagan was up for a second term that year, and he was invited to the inaugural ball. David wanted me to go, too. Now, I do know people who would be delighted to go to the inaugural ball just to see what it's like. But I was so superstitious, I was sure God would strike me dead for hobnobbing with the richest and meanest congregation on Earth."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:51:28.10","So I went back to the voodoo lady. She told me what to do. First I had to take an apple and cut out its core. Then I was to write my problem on a piece of paper and put it inside. Then I had to wrap the apple with a black ribbon while I chanted, bind him, bind him, take away his power and set me free. And then, on the first night of the new moon, I buried the apple in the nuns' graveyard behind the Sacred Heart Church."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:51:58.23","The next day, the children and I drove to Cincinnati where an old Hell's Angel friend of mine ran a tattoo parlor. I got him to put a big red heart and dagger up high on my bicep. I knew no good Republican man would ever want to be seen with me again. And you know what? He didn't."
"43","Faustian Bargains","1996-11-22","5","Act Five. First Contact","host","Carmen Delzell","00:52:16.84","The truth is that like any other Third World country that tries to cut itself off from America too quickly, our economy has never recovered. And that's why tonight by the full moon, I have returned to the bar where we first made our fateful bargain to beg him for enough money to pay the rent. They say that once you start messing with the occult, you're forever in its debt."
