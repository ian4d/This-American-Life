","host","Ira Glass","00:00:01.80","In Danielle's house, ever since she was a girl, when dinner comes, sometimes they serve a meal that might look familiar to you. Here's the main course. On a big platter, picture drumsticks, white breast meat, golden brown skin."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","host","Ira Glass","00:00:17.32","Somebody carves this. Perhaps on a holiday, there's stuffing and cranberry relish on the side. And in Danielle's family, they have a name for this meal. As she told me on the phone recently, the name for this meal is--"

We stand at this moment between the poultry of Thanksgiving and the poultry of Christmas. This is the peak poultry moment in our American year. Something like a fourth, a little less than a fourth of all the turkey consumed in this country consumed during these few weeks."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","host","Ira Glass","00:01:20.62","And to honor that, we bring you this evening an odd variety of stories and things you would not hear elsewhere, as we always do of course. Things you not would hear elsewhere-- just transpose the words of that sentence yourselves at home. I'm not going to do that for you-- about turkeys, chickens, ducks, fowl of all kind and their mysterious hold over us."

"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","host","Ira Glass","00:02:43.12","Yes, indeed. In the late 1960s, the winged warrior Chickenman struck terror in the hearts of evildoers everywhere, on Chicago radio first and then across the nation. Tonight, we're going to bring you a historic first, the first new episode since 1969, later. That will be later, later."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","host","Ira Glass","00:03:03.35","See, because we're savvy broadcasters here. Even though it's public broadcasting, we're going to make you wait 'til later in the show for that. We know many of you are tuning in for that, and we're going to make you wait."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","host","Ira Glass","00:03:20.90","OK, to return to our story. Danielle's family. The power of poultry is so great in their lives that when they serve chicken or turkey, they call it--"

"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","host","Ira Glass","00:03:29.91","That's right. And they call it this for a reason. And the reason has to do with this stuffed hand puppet called Duki."

"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:03:56.22","Well, he was a Christmas present when Ashley was about eight and I was about 10. And when he first arrived he was really fluffy. And he was this beautiful, fluffy, white duck. And he had a cape on and black kind of villain/hero goggles. I guess we'd call it hero goggles. And I think he was, because there was an S on his cape, I'm sure he was supposed to be Superduck or something."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:04:25.81","And he's a puppet. He lost the outfit pretty quickly, and he went naked. And then he became Ashley's vehicle for torturing me."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","host","Ira Glass","00:04:42.89","Now it is not unusual for older siblings to dominate younger ones. And as children, Danielle pretty much would dominate Ashley. Danielle always got her way, except, except when Duki was around."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","host","Ira Glass","00:04:58.19","And basically what would happen is Ashley would channel-- that's kind of an anachronism to use that word in this context-- but Ashley would channel Duki's voice. She would speak as Duki. She would produce the Duki-like voice. And Duki was sarcastic and selfish and bossy. Duki would insult and tease Danielle and give her painful nose squeaks."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:05:23.77","Whenever Ashley brought Duki into the equation, he was completely the dominant force. I was just putty in Duki's hands."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:05:33.82","Let me ask you to compare his personality with Ashley's personality."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:05:40.23","Ashley's very considerate. She's very considerate and kind and thoughtful, and very, very sensitive to other people. Very, very concerned about if other people are happy or if someone else doesn't feel good. And Duki has this total ""What's for lunch?"" attitude, like ""What's in it for me?"" in your face, totally out for himself, simultaneously a braggart and a total wimp."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:06:11.12","He's boastful and vain."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:06:12.72","He's just this indomitable spirit. Well, lately, he's at U Mich with my sister. And he tried out for the football team. They've got a good football team there."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:06:24.64","Nationally ranked."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:06:25.81","And he said he didn't make it. But he said it was because they thought he'd be more valuable in the band. And they got a good band, too. So apparently, he goes to band practice every day."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:06:39.45","And they've got him playing the triangle. He's playing the triangle in the band. And he couldn't come home for Thanksgiving because he had to go be at practice."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","host","Ira Glass","00:06:53.71","18 years after Duki arrived in the Mattoon household, I can say, I think fairly accurately, that the fluffy whiteness is long gone. ""Fluffy"" is not a word-- you would never use that word with Duki anymore. Nor is two-eyed, actually, if I remember correctly."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:07:13.76","What he looks like, physical-- he's like a slightly pathetic-looking grey, tattered thing."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:07:21.90","Very tattered."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:07:23.82","Very tattered. But then the fact that his brain, like what's coming out of his mouth, is in complete denial about who he actually is. I don't know. There's just something really, really great about that. And really, you have to love-- you love him for it."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","host","Ira Glass","00:07:49.78","OK, I have been at Danielle's house sometimes and witnessed the following scene. Picture this. Danielle has not spoken with her sister in weeks, picks up the phone, calls her sister Ashley in Michigan. Ashley answers. Danielle asks immediately, ""Can you put Duki on the line?"" And then Ashley essentially becomes Duki, puts Duki on the line. Danielle talks to Duki for 15, 20 minutes. And then they both hang up. That's the whole conversation. And they both feel satisfied."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:08:26.87","I adore Duki. I really love Duki. And sometimes I think if he disappeared, it would really feel like someone died. I mean, I look at him and he looks really old and ratty. And it really makes me sad."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:08:40.08","Really, I feel like-- it sounds crazy. It really makes me sad to think about a world without Duki, and that it would be a big, empty hole in the world. He takes up as much room in my heart as a lot of people individually. And if something happened to him, if he were lost at an airport or run over by a car, it would really be heartbreaking."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","host","Ira Glass","00:09:12.06","So I hope that it's becoming clear why, when you eat dinner in the home of Danielle's family, if they are serving some kind of poultry, chicken or turkey, if you ask anyone in the family what's for dinner, they'll tell you--"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:09:29.48","Fish."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:09:30.07","Right. And the rationale for that is what?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:09:33.44","It freaks Duki out."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:09:35.38","It freaks him out, though-- you don't like him to know that perhaps some birds are, in fact, eaten?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:09:41.25","I think he knows. I think he's in denial about it. He's in denial about most things. He's in denial about the fact that he's totally weak and tiny and dirty. He thinks he's really good-looking and strong, and that he's really smart and has a lot of friends."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:10:00.56","He's in denial about the fact that he's actually stuffed, which he is. Sometimes I tell him that. I say, ""Duki, give me a break. You're just stuffed."" And he's like, ""No way."""
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","host","Ira Glass","00:10:13.95","Now I thought I would try to book Duki to come on the radio for this show. So a few weeks ago, I contacted Danielle's sister, Ashley. And I asked her if Duki could come on the air."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","host","Ira Glass","00:10:26.37","And I didn't get a call back. I got an answer back by electronic mail that for Duki to appear, I would have to call someone named Yona Lu, who I could reach through Danielle and Ashley's mom. And when I talked with Danielle, I asked her about this."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:10:43.84","I've been informed that the only way that I can reach him is by calling your mom and speaking to Yona Lu? Do I have that name right?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:10:50.83","Yona Lu, yeah. I think she's acting as his agent."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:10:54.83","Yona Lu is--"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:10:56.31","She's a hedgehog."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:11:01.14","Anything special that I should say to Yona Lu?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:11:04.21","I don't know. She's drives a pretty hard bargain."

"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:11:11.52","Hey, Mrs. Mattoon?"

"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:11:15.55","Mrs. Mattoon, here's why I called you. I want to do a little story on the radio about Duki."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:11:22.78","Duki."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:11:23.29","Duki. And I contacted your daughter, Ashley. And she said that for me to book Duki on to my radio show, I was going to first need to contact Yona Lu."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:11:36.16","Yeah, you would need to do that."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:11:38.06","And that I needed to do that through you."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:11:39.84","Yeah."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:11:41.35","Who is Yona Lu?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:11:42.47","Yona Lu is-- she's a hedgehog. She's basically taken charge of Duki's financial affairs. And I presume this has something to do with money?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:11:56.96","I don't know, actually. I mean, we--"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:11:59.36","That's probably why she said to contact Yona Lu."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:12:02.02","Well, so what do I do now? I was told to contact you if I wanted to get in touch with Yona Lu in order to book Duki. What do I do next?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:12:11.67","Book Duki, OK. You're going to book Duki."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:12:14.57","That's the whole idea. I want to book Duki for the show, for an interview."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:12:17.82","Well, I'll just talk to Yona Lu about it. She says OK, it's OK."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:12:25.13","Will Yona Lu want to discuss terms or something?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:12:27.98","She doesn't talk."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:12:31.77","So what's going to happen? All right. Should I call you back?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:12:35.81","You could call me back. Or I'd just go in and check."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:12:39.84","You'll just go in and check."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:12:40.85","Yeah."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:12:41.14","Should I wait?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:12:41.90","Yeah."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:12:42.17","All right, I'll wait."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:12:55.19","Ira?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:12:55.61","Yeah."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:12:56.14","This is just radio?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:12:57.20","Yeah."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:12:57.84","Not TV?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:12:58.83","It's just radio."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:13:01.40","And nobody's going to get to be on TV?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:13:03.52","[LAUGHTER]"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:13:06.49","No, no one's going to be on TV. No, it's strictly radio."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:13:09.93","OK, Yona Lu doesn't care what happens then."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:13:12.87","What if it were TV?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:13:14.22","I think she'd want to be on, too."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:13:16.01","[LAUGHTER]"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:13:19.25","Radio doesn't do much for her, she doesn't talk."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","host","Ira Glass","00:13:23.63","OK. In Danielle's family-- I guess you're figuring this out. There's Duki. There's Yona Lu. And then there are four or five other characters, Therese-- I can never keep all their names straight-- who live in this world that's fleshed out with a lot of vivid detail and drama. They have a club called The Smart Set, and people are forever falling in and out of favor with The Smart Set."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","host","Ira Glass","00:13:46.74","Anyway, there are jealousies. There are rivalries. People fight for favors and treats and invitations to ice cream socials. And each of the characters corresponds to some stuffed doll that Danielle and Ashley received as children."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","host","Ira Glass","00:14:03.42","Though a few months ago, Danielle and Ashley were talking. And they realized that one of the characters, Guy Frank, didn't seem to correspond to any particular doll that they could remember. Where did he come from?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","host","Ira Glass","00:14:21.74","They attempted to recall this. And then one of them did. Guy Frank is Duki's imaginary friend. Duki is such a fully realized imaginary friend that he has his own imaginary friend."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","host","Ira Glass","00:14:41.86","As you might imagine, not everyone in the family takes all this so lightly. Danielle's father, for example, was never too keen on it."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:14:49.28","He was quite actually bothered by the whole-- he thought we maybe had a problem in the family."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:14:55.28","Really?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:14:55.97","Mm-hmm. For a while there, we had two daughters that only communicated through a duck."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:15:04.63","Yeah. That period that you're describing, when do you mean?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:15:07.83","I would say they maybe were 10 and 12 or 9 and 11."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:15:10.71","And they would only communicate through the duck?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Mrs. Mattoon","00:15:13.79","Well, Danielle didn't pay a whole lot of attention to Ashley but she paid quite a lot of attention to the duck. So if Ashley wanted to get Danielle's attention all she had to do was rev up the duck. Danielle thought Duki was very funny, but I can't remember her thinking Ashley was funny."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","1","Act One. ","subject","Danielle","00:15:38.68","In terms of the relationship between my sister and me, this is probably completely really sick. But I have so much genuine affection and love for Duki that it's very easy to demonstrate those feelings. It's not as easy to demonstrate those feelings toward my sister, just because we never got in the habit of it."

"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:25:20.32","I'm Julie Showalter. I grew up on a turkey farm in southwest Missouri. ""The night 3,000 turkeys died."" The day before the night that 3,000 turkeys died, we moved 13,000 turkeys to the range."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:25:36.94","This requires some explanation. Turkeys spend their first 16 weeks in a heated brooder house. When they are 16 weeks old, they are put outside to range in fenced enclosures."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:25:48.91","Daddy decided we would herd them to the range. It looked simple enough. We made a temporary chute of wire fencing that ran from the double-end doors of the brooder house 50 yards to the pen. We would get behind the turkeys in the brooder house, shout, wave old shirts and gunny sacks at them, and they would run out the doors, through the chute, into the pen."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:26:09.75","And that's the way it worked in the first brooder house. The first turkeys hesitated at the door, walked out cautiously, then moved through the chute and dispersed. The rest followed. It took about an hour. Daddy was pleased. ""Let's work straight through,"" he said. ""We'll be done by 10:00."""
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:26:29.51","By the time the turkeys have been in a brooder house for 16 weeks, the air is filled with ammonia, feather particles, and dust. The stench is overwhelming. After an hour in the brooder house, your lungs hurt for a day."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:26:43.36","You can contract disabling lung diseases from working only a week in a poultry house. Tiny barbed pieces of feather dig into the tissue of your lung and never let go. But we didn't know that then."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:26:57.09","We moved the temporary fence to the doors of the second brooder house. When we threw open the doors at the end of the second house, it was 9:00 in the morning. The sun streamed in the open doors on turkeys that had never seen direct sunlight."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:27:11.14","The one thing you can count on with turkeys is that you never know how they are going to react. I've seen turkeys clamber against a fence trying to get into a range fire. I've seen them rush toward a screaming child, trying to kill it. And I've seen them run from a screaming child, spooked and terrified."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:27:29.67","These turkeys didn't want to go into the sun. As we pushed from behind, they compacted. It was like an old adventure movie where the walls are closing in. But there was no wall at the end, only a patch of sunlight which turkeys would not touch."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:27:44.23","We yelled louder, waved our cloths, kicked at the ones in the rear. Finally, Daddy walked through the solid carpet of turkeys to break the logjam at the front. He stood at the edge of the sunlight, lifting the turkeys three or four at a time with his feet, stirring them with this legs, forcing them into the sun."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:28:02.79","Suddenly, they broke free. As stubbornly as they had refused to go into the light, they now rushed toward it. They ran in a panic, piling on top of each other, knocking down the temporary fence. By the time Daddy could get the doors closed, at least 1,000 turkeys had escaped and were running free on the farm, onto our neighbor's farm, into the road."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:28:27.32","We didn't own the turkeys. We raised them for a company that owned the hatchery, the feed mill, the fleet of trucks that delivered and loaded the turkeys, the processing plant. We got a portion of the profits, if there were profits."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:28:42.97","With 1,000 turkeys gone, there would be no profits on this flock. 16 weeks of Daddy working 14-hour days, of my sisters and me working alongside him any time we weren't in school, all for no pay. And if we weren't paid for this flock, we would have no cash coming in until the next flock was raised."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:29:04.67","It took us eight hours to round up the escaped turkeys, four of us trying to track down 1,000 birds that had the whole world in which to hide and run from us. The sun beat down, and the air was thick and humid. We stopped once for water, and my sister, Billie, the youngest of us, just 11, vomited from the cold water hitting her stomach after hours of sun, heat, and dehydration."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:29:30.24","As she lay on the ground, shaking and holding her stomach, I hated her for being the one too sick to continue. But even she was not too sick. We all went on. She got an extra five minutes to rest, but we all went on."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:29:48.36","You may be asking right now how my father could be so cruel, how he could work young girls like that? Or you may think that I'm exaggerating, that self-pity has magnified our distress. I tell you, this is no exaggeration. And I tell you, my father had no choice. Or that any choice he had was so far in the past that there was no unraveling it. Years later, when we were grown, we caught a glimpse of his guilt, his bitterness over what he had done to us. ""I couldn't afford niggers,"" he told my sister Billie. ""So I had daughters."""
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:30:30.59","At 6 o'clock, we rebuilt the chute. We opened the doors, and the 6,000 remaining turkeys, the sun now low in the sky behind them, walked through to the pen. We cleaned up. We ate supper. And we went to bed. That's the day we had before the night 3,000 turkeys died."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:30:52.53","At midnight, Mother woke us up. ""We have to get to the pen. Daddy needs us."" We had been too exhausted to hear the storm. We ran out in the driving rain. Flashes of lightning showed Daddy picking up turkeys and throwing them, one after the other."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:31:10.75","When people learn I grew up on a turkey farm, they invariably ask, ""Is it true? Are they really so stupid that they open their mouths in the rain, look up at the sky, and drown?"" The answer is yes, some of them do that. They are that stupid. But that's not how 3,000 die in one night."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:31:33.30","They die because they are scared, and they huddle together in their fear. They climb on top of each other, trying to get close, to find protection in the mass of bodies. And they suffocate."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:31:48.01","We called it piling. It wasn't unusual for a loud noise to cause a pile in the brooder house. If there wasn't someone to pull them off each other, 50 could die because someone slammed a door."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:32:01.05","But this was worse than any pile we'd seen, turkeys who'd never spent a night outdoors panicked by thunder, lightning, and rain in sheets. All we could do is pull them out of the pile and throw them away from it. They would run back, still seeking the comfort of the group."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:32:19.72","After a while standing in mud, grabbing soaked turkeys, throwing them, grabbing more, you don't know if the ones you are throwing are dead or alive. You don't care. Maybe we saved some."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","2","Act Two","host","Julie Showalter","00:32:36.08","The next day, the sky was cloudless, and the sun bore down on us again. We picked up dead turkeys, throwing them onto the back of a flatbed truck. Daddy drove the truck into a field far from the house. He poured gasoline on them and struck a match. They burned for days."

It was enough to drive one crazy. Often, I open my back window that faced the alley just across from the backyard where the rooster made his home. ""Shut up, or I'll blow your stinking brains out,"" I'd yell. Great communication technique."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","3","Act Three","host","Luis Rodriguez","00:34:31.99","It worked on the brats next door, but the rooster never flinched. With calm aplomb, it continued to squawk. For one thing, the rooster never gave out a bona fide cock-a-doodle. It sort of shouted it out."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","3","Act Three","host","Luis Rodriguez","00:34:48.49","It happened that the rooster lived with three dogs, a German Shepherd and two mutts. The dogs barked through their existence. They barked at everything in sight. I finally concluded that rooster thought it was a dog. Somehow, I didn't mind the dogs barking. But when a rooster barks, that's murder."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","3","Act Three","host","Luis Rodriguez","00:35:08.11","In fact, I often saw it running alongside the dogs as they raced across the dirt yard, barking at passing cars or people. If the dogs went left, the rooster went left. They'd go right, and dang if that rooster didn't go right as well. Now I don't know if this is a regular condition for roosters."

"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","3","Act Three","host","Luis Rodriguez","00:35:41.26","But once I grasped the heart of the matter, I began to see the rooster in another light. I felt sorry for this fowl with an identity problem. And I wondered how it must react when its owners threw chicken bones to the dogs. Would it nibble on the remains of its favorite hen? I shuddered at the thought."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","3","Act Three","host","Luis Rodriguez","00:36:01.88","Yet despite the revelation of the rooster's bark, the problem of sleep didn't end. Then one day, a new neighbor, a young lady, who often drank herself to bliss, got a gun and blew the rooster away. She became somewhat of a local hero."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","3","Act Three","host","Luis Rodriguez","00:36:17.72","I must say, though, it was an unfitting end for the bird. But I suppose one can tolerate barking dogs. But barking roosters? That's another matter altogether."

"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","5","Act Five","host","David Sedaris","00:46:44.86","I pass the usual objects, the grinning mammies offering themselves up as salt and pepper shakers, the coffee table made from dice, another head carved from a coconut. ""That's collectible,"" the dealers say, referring to an ashtray in the shape of a doll-sized toilet bowl. Collectible to who?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","5","Act Five","host","David Sedaris","00:47:04.94","Last weekend at the flea market, I saw this thing, a taxidermied turkey's head attached to its own foot. This turkey was equipped with that length of flesh that spills from the top of its beak and fell to its neck. Stiff red hair stood out from the head and shoulders, and the claws were really sharp. You'd think that something armed like that might be able to protect itself."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","5","Act Five","host","David Sedaris","00:47:28.20","I pictured its maker standing by a chopping block saying, ""I know. I'll take the turkey's head and attach it to the foot."" Why would you do that? Or more importantly, what sort of life would you lead that might enable you to make this connection?"
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","5","Act Five","host","David Sedaris","00:47:47.77","I was hypnotized by this object and asked the price as if I were under a spell. ""$45,"" the dealer said. My tongue was dry from hanging in the open air, and I tried to fit it back into my mouth. ""All right,"" she said, ""$35. $30."" But she could have gone up. ""All right. $85. $120. $370."""
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","5","Act Five","host","David Sedaris","00:48:09.44","I had no choice but to follow wherever she led me. I handed over my wallet in a trance, just gave it to her, thinking she could take the whole thing, the cash, blank checks, library card, whatever. Take it all."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","5","Act Five","host","David Sedaris","00:48:23.12","I stared into the face of this taxidermied turkey's head, and nothing else mattered. Tomorrow, what's that? Yesterday doesn't count. My life began the moment I could call this thing my own."
"3","Poultry Slam 1995","1995-12-01","5","Act Five","host","David Sedaris","00:48:36.29","On the way home I felt giddy and confident that I could approach anyone at all and say, ""I'll give you one hundred-- no, $500,000 if you can guess what I've got in this paper sack."" And I swear that not one of them could have come up with the right answer. I walked home 30 blocks, looking everyone square in the eye and thinking, ""Sucker."""
