"48","Justice","1997-01-03","1","Act One. International Justice","host","Ira Glass","00:00:00.67","What's it take to put the past behind us? What's it take for a whole country to do it? Consider this story. After World War II, the Nuremberg trials documented German war crime atrocities and the Holocaust. But Germans didn't accept it. Historians have noted that, as far as the Germans were concerned, Nuremberg wasn't real justice. It was just a bunch of outsiders coming in after the war, imposing victor's justice."

"48","Justice","1997-01-03","1","Act One. International Justice","host","Ira Glass","00:01:01.33",""
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Ira Glass","00:01:43.73","Act One. Well, ever since the end of World War II, there's been this idealistic notion kicking around that when nations do horrible things, the best way to deal with it, to put those things to rest, would be to have a court somewhere, a court for war crimes, for crimes against humanity. And now, for the first time since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials at the end of World War II, a court like this is actually in session. This is the war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Ira Glass","00:02:09.74","Just like the Nuremberg trials, this is justice administered by outsiders. These trials are happening far from the Balkans. They're in the Hague, in the Netherlands. There are lawyers and judges from Egypt, and France, and Sri Lanka, and Canada, and lots of Americans there. Kitty Felde is a familiar voice to public radio listeners for her coverage of the O. J. Simpson trial and the Rodney King beating trial, but over the course of the last year, she spent several weeks in the Hague, watching this new form of justice take place."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:02:34.76","Gabrielle Kirk McDonald is arguably the most powerful African-American woman in the world, but you've probably never heard of her. McDonald is the presiding judge for the first international war crimes trial in half a century. As she sits in her judicial robes week after week inside the courtroom, it becomes clear that Judge McDonald is like most Americans when it comes to things foreign. We can't read the maps."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Gabrielle Kirk Mcdonald","00:03:00.05","Mr. [? Doko ?] was from [? Boski-- ?] [? Boskisamic, ?] maybe, was he? Somewhere up there, as I recall."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:03:06.27","We don't know the history, and we have the devil of a time pronouncing the names."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Gabrielle Kirk Mcdonald","00:03:10.62","The witness, Mr. Gros-- Grovs-- Grovesdenat--"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Woman","00:03:14.75","[? Grozenich ?], yes, your Honor."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Gabrielle Kirk Mcdonald","00:03:15.61","Anyway, he testified."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:03:17.50","But Judge McDonald also brings to the tribunal another American attribute-- her idealism."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Gabrielle Kirk Mcdonald","00:03:22.92","I love the law. I like solving problems, and I think, for, certainly, a racial minority, I think that the use of our laws in the United States is the way that we bring about equality and inclusion."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:03:39.58","And McDonald isn't the only American working at the tribunal."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Alan Tieger","00:03:43.06","By the time you left [UNINTELLIGIBLE], about 90% of the Muslim community had been killed, forced out."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:03:52.30","Prosecutor Alan Tieger is on loan to the tribunal from the Department of Justice. About two dozen American lawyers, investigators, and other experts have been seconded-- or loaned out-- to the tribunal, their salaries paid by the US government. Americans make up the largest legal community at the tribunal. The contingent is so large, some complain that through sheer numbers, they're turning what's supposed to be a brand-new legal system into something that looks a lot like US Constitutional law."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:04:21.88","Most of the Americans are here out of a sense of moral conviction. Alan Tieger, like Judge McDonald, was a civil rights lawyer. He was one of the prosecutors at the federal Rodney King beating trial. His parents were Holocaust survivors. The prosecution's chief investigator, Terree Bowers, says he came to the Hague to do work of significance to humankind. But from the start, his new job presented challenges he never faced in his old position as head of the US Attorney's Office in Los Angeles."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Terree Bowers","00:04:52.17","I mean, when we went into Tuzla, we flew into the airport, and the next morning, the Serbs started shelling the airport. So we weren't even able to get out. Where you have to dodge artillery, and some areas you just can't get into, immediately, we knew that we were up against an enormous challenge to put these cases together."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:05:16.76","There were all sorts of challenges. And one thing in particular that Americans, and other non-Yugoslavs at the tribunal found so very difficult to understand-- the now familiar stories of neighbor turning against neighbor, almost overnight. Judge McDonald asked witness after witness about this, over and over again."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Gabrielle Kirk Mcdonald","00:05:37.87","I guess my question, and perhaps it's not a fair question, I don't know that you could give a complete answer, but perhaps you can help me to understand since I am not from that area, how could you explain that some of the atrocities that we've heard have been committed? How can you explain that something like that would happen, given your background, given your experience, knowing that Serbs and Muslims lived together, went to school together, intermarried? How did it happen?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:06:10.66","She never found an answer that satisfied her. And as the trial wore on, she and other judges found themselves searching for something in their own experiences to explain it. And that raises this question, what does it mean when people with one sort of history are trying and judging people with a very different sort?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Man","00:06:30.46","The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is now in session. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Please be seated."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:06:42.43","It was back in May of 1993 that the United Nations Security Council set up the tribunal at the urging of the US and Western Europe. At the time, NATO was resisting pleas from the Bosnians to come to their aid in the war, and cynics suggested that the West set up the tribunal simply because it was easier to commit lawyers than troops."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Gabrielle Kirk Mcdonald","00:07:03.86","Some people feel that the tribunal was created as kind of an apology because the world community wasn't doing anything."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:07:10.44","Again, Judge McDonald."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Gabrielle Kirk Mcdonald","00:07:12.61","I don't care. I don't care what their reason was. The point is that we have been established. And I think that we're making a contribution."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:07:23.86","But to see just how difficult it is to make a contribution, consider the case of Witness L. The tribunal allows witnesses who fear for their lives to testify behind closed doors, their identities secret. Witness L explained to the tribunal that he was a guard at one of the Serb-run prison camps, where he witnessed the tribunal's first defendant, a Bosnian Serb karate teacher named Dusan Tadic, commit more crimes."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:07:52.52","The prosecution had other witnesses who told of Tadic delivering brutal beatings, but L was the only credible witness who saw Tadic rape and kill people. L testified about one incident where 10 elderly men were taken into the infamous white house, the scene of most tortures at the Omarska prison camp."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:08:10.92","According to L, Tadic pointed to him and said, ""Come here and perform the killing of these 10 prisoners."" L answered, ""Why me? Why do I have to do it?"" Tadic apparently grew impatient. L said Tadic approached the prisoners and shot two of them in the head, point blank. It was dramatic, damning testimony, the strongest brought forward by the prosecution."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:08:33.38","Unfortunately, it wasn't true. Two months after L's initial court appearance, prosecutors had to stand before the court and admit that L had lied on the stand. He had never been a camp guard. He'd never witnessed the alleged atrocities. He'd never even seen Dusan Tadic in person until he walked into the courtroom. Prosecution investigator Robert Reid told the court L was a Bosnian Serb soldier. He said he'd been caught by the Bosnian Muslim army, and then was coerced into testifying."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Robert Reid","00:09:05.53","He said that after his initial interview by the military, he was transferred to Sarajevo, where he spoke with police interrogators for seven hours a day, for about one month. The purpose of these conversations was to train Witness L to give evidence against [UNINTELLIGIBLE] Tadic. I then asked him why he'd pleaded guilty to something that he had never done, and he stated that he'd been threatened that if he did not cooperate with the Bosnian authorities, that he'd be executed."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:09:34.32","In the weeks since then, the prosecution says it's uncovered new evidence that shows the Bosnian Serb government didn't coach Witness L. At this point, it's unclear what to believe of his testimony, and the whole episode raises disturbing questions for the Americans and Western Europeans who first pushed for the establishment of the international criminal tribunal."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:09:57.24","If these trials were designed to get at the truth, they were being tainted by a witness who lied. If they were trying to bring justice to the victims, it was those victims-- the Muslims, in this case-- who were fabricating evidence, trying to swing the verdict their way."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Man","00:10:14.98","The accused, would you rise, please, and state your identity, Mr. Erdemovic."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Drazen Erdemovic","00:10:21.80","Drazen Erdemovic. I was born in Tuzla in 1971. I'm a Croat by nationality."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:10:31.94","Thus far, the tribunal has only handed down one sentence. It's a case where no one disputes the basic facts of the crime. This was the case of Drazen Erdemovic. It's a story of a man who risked his life and his freedom to tell the world the truth about what he'd done."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:10:50.06","Erdemovic is 25, a baby-faced kid with acne scars. He's Croatian. His wife is a Serb. They have a young son. Erdemovic was trained as a tool and dye maker. But by the time he had learned his trade, the war had broken out, so he became a career soldier, and served with all three armies during the war. But he says he chose combat units that conducted reconnaissance missions and manned border checkpoints, jobs where he didn't have to kill anyone."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:11:19.59","Until July of 1995, that's when his special battalion of the Bosnian Serb army, the 10th sabotage unit, was ordered to a farm field near Pilica. It was shortly after the fall of Srebrenica. The UN had set up a safe area there, where 25,000 Bosnian Muslims had fled for protection. But when the Bosnian Serb army attacked, the tiny UN force didn't offer much resistance. In fact, UN peacekeepers helped load Muslim men onto buses that took them away, never to be seen again."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:11:52.24","Erdemovic and his unit had been given instructions on how to kill large numbers of people in a short period of time. And then the buses started arriving. The first group of 10 wore blindfolds, their hands tied behind their backs. Erdemovic and his comrades were then ordered to shoot the prisoners in the back."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Drazen Erdemovic","00:12:13.22","I was sorry for those people, simply. I had no reason to shoot at those people. They had done nothing to me."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:12:24.49","But Erdemovic emptied his rifle again and again, killing as many as 100 of the 1,200 killed that day."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Drazen Erdemovic","00:12:31.37","Your honor, I had to do this. If I had refused, I would've been killed together with the victims. When I refused, they told me, if you're sorry for them, stand up, line up with them, and we will kill you, too."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:12:52.76","Erdemovic's unit was then ordered to a nearby town where, perhaps, 500 other Bosnian Muslims were being held inside a meeting hall. He and his unit were ordered to kill them as well. Erdemovic says, this time, he did refuse, saying, wasn't there enough blood? Weren't there enough dead people? Erdemovic says he didn't care what happened to himself anymore. He told American prosecutor Mark Harmon, ""I didn't want to become a robot for extermination."""
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Mark Harmon","00:13:20.53","Are you able to estimate how many people you killed?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Drazen Erdemovic","00:13:31.40","I don't know exactly. I can't estimate. But to be quite frank, I'd rather not know how many people I killed."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:13:40.33","Erdemovic's refusal to kill again did not go unnoticed by his comrades. A few days later, in a bar fight, one of them shot him four times. Erdemovic says it was because they knew he couldn't keep his mouth shut. And he couldn't. Erdemovic says after the massacre, he couldn't sleep. He stayed away from home and drank. After he had partially recovered from the gunshot wounds, he says he finally decided to tell his story to the war crimes tribunal. But there was no tribunal representative anywhere nearby."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:14:12.26",""
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Drazen Erdemovic","00:14:47.43","I just wanted the truth to be known, and for someone to understand that this actually happened, and how these people had lost their lives. Because as we heard today, nobody knew about the place of Pilica, that a crime had happened there, and what kind of crime. Perhaps that's where most people were killed. And to have someone believe me, that I really had to do it, that I didn't want to do it, that's why."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:15:17.53","Judges deciding his case had a difficult time understanding how Erdemovic got himself into such a no-win situation. Why didn't he just flee the country? Erdemovic explained, you couldn't get a passport until you'd completed your military service. And by then, the war had broken out. Egyptian judge Fouad Riad questioned why he kept enlisting in the army."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Fouad Riad","00:15:40.00","You pleaded very much the cause of peace. At the same time, you happened to join all the fighting groups during this war. Wasn't there any other way to express your belief in coexistence?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Drazen Erdemovic","00:16:07.34","How shall I put it? We were forced to join the army. I had received those call-up papers. I had no one to turn to. Who was I? I was just a simple Drazen Erdemovic with nobody who would listen to me."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:16:22.97","Erdemovic grew increasingly frustrated at the judges' questioning. He cried several times on the stand. At one point, he and the French judge Claude Jorda began shouting at each other in their native languages, neither one waiting for translation."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Claude Jorda","00:16:37.29","[SPEAKING FRENCH]."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Drazen Erdemovic","00:16:45.43","I was against the war. I didn't want the war. I had no motives. I had no motivation to go to war. Is there anyone here who can understand me? My wife is a Serb. Was I supposed to hate her because she is a Serbian? I apologize, but let me explain this to you. I do understand this, but this is the 12th time that I'm repeating my story, the story of how my life has been destroyed. Please try to understand me. This is the 12th time I'm doing this."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:17:21.92","Erdemovic even pulled up his shirt to show the two-foot scar on his belly, the result of several operations to repair damage done by his comrade's bullets. Judge Jorda was unmoved."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Claude Jorda","00:17:32.86","I understand that it is painful for you. We understand that you were caught in a storm, but that is not a reason for us, just like that, to say that these many, many people who were killed simply will be written off."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:17:49.49","Prosecutors say they never would have known what had happened to those 1,200 victims if Erdemovic had not come forward. Yet the tribunal judges sentenced him to 10 years behind bars for his role in the killings, dismissing his claims that he had no choice but to shoot. The judges said they only had his word on it."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:18:09.61","So here, the tribunal has sentenced its first war criminal, a kid they have in custody only because he chose to come forward and tell his story. And yet, the colonel who gave the orders to shoot hasn't even been charged with a crime. And while General Ratko Mladic, the military men at the top, has been indicted, he, like dozens of other indicted war criminals, remains a free man."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:18:33.65","Is this justice, punishing only the small fish? Louise Arbour, the Canadian chief prosecutor at the tribunal, gets angry when Erdemovic is described as a little fish."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Louise Arbour","00:18:44.51","How small a fish can you be when you're prepared to admit to the killing of 100 people? By any national standard, this would be the biggest crime in the history of that country. And so I find that level of cynicism a bit disconcerting, that people are saying, well, don't waste my time with mere killers of hundreds, I'd like to see killers of thousands."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:19:06.15","Which brings us to the biggest problem facing the tribunal. Unlike most criminal justice systems, the tribunal has no police force of its own. And so it has no way of bringing fugitives to justice. The Yugoslav tribunal has indicted 75 people so far. One has died, seven are in custody, and the rest are working and living free in the former Yugoslavia."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:19:29.59","Under the Dayton Accord, the Bosnian, Serbian, and Croatian governments are supposed to hand over indicted war criminals living in their territories. With rare exceptions, this hasn't happened. Under Dayton, NATO troops are also authorized to make arrests of any indicted war criminals they encounter. The joke at the tribunal is that NATO troops have to cross the street not to run into them."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:19:51.71","If the international community doesn't follow through with its commitment to the tribunal, if indicted war criminals are allowed to remain free, it sends exactly the opposite message from the one Americans at the tribunal were hoping to send. It says, essentially, that future Karadzics and Mladics can commit any atrocities they want, and the world won't bother to bring them to justice."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:20:18.06","The Dutch, like most Europeans, are not a particularly church-going people. Every small town boasts of a beautiful cathedral, but it's usually empty. When a holiday called [? Tweede ?] Pinksteren rolled around one Monday, none of the locals in the court knew it was, and we foreigners had to consultant a liturgical calendar to find out it was the second day of Pentecost."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:20:40.51","So here in the midst of this rather secular society is a trial about another society, where religious divisions became a matter of life and death. And in this setting, those who come to work every day at the tribunal are the truly faithful. The world community won't arrest the criminals they indict, those who fought the war don't seem particularly interested in the truth about it, the international media ignores what they're doing, but still, the lawyers and the judges come in and examine evidence, they work on their cases, true believers in the idea that the rule of law is the only way to create a lasting peace."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Kitty Felde","00:21:18.82","Sitting there day after day, I remembered an old Islamic proverb that says one hour of doing justice is worth 100 in prayer. They come to this brick temple of a courthouse every day to do their praying by working for justice, even if no one hears their prayer."

"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Ira Glass","00:22:03.05",""
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","host","Ira Glass","00:22:38.10","He tells this story. In June of 1996, he was asked to chair a discussion of historians from Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia. And all of these had been people who had opposed the war. Most of them, in fact, had been close friends before the war. And they hadn't given in to the national hatreds inflamed by the war. They'd remained friends. It was about 30 people."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Michael Ignatieff","00:22:57.68","And I got them around a table, and I asked them, at one point, don't you think it would be possible for you all to get together and produce a history of the war that is a simple narrative of how this catastrophe happened to your three societies? There was a kind of deafening silence after I made this liberal, well-meaning proposal."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Michael Ignatieff","00:23:21.53","And people then just said, a common history is impossible. We couldn't do it. We couldn't even agree what events should be included. We couldn't even agree on when the war began. I mean, some people think the war began in June 1991 when the JNA tanks marched into Slovenia. Other people think the war began in '85 and '86 when Serbian nationalism began to take off."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Michael Ignatieff","00:23:50.07","Even simple factual questions become, in other words, questions of attribution of responsibility and questions of guilt. I mean, it'll take generations, and I'm not sure that outsiders can do it. It's like a family trauma. And as a family, they will have to talk it out. But it will take 30, 40, 50 years."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:24:13.88","So what do you make of this notion of the Americans and the other foreigners who are holding the tribunal that, OK, we're going to get at the truth?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Michael Ignatieff","00:24:21.74","Well, I don't want to be cynical about that, because I think juridical truth is terribly important. And here, I think, outsiders can play a limited role, because an outsider can say, here are the forensic facts about certain war crimes, and we can establish them. An international tribunal can establish what war crimes happened, where, by whom, and to whom."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Michael Ignatieff","00:24:47.03","There's no guarantee that that truth will then reach out through the society at large, but at least it constitutes one kind of place, somewhere, where honest men can find what actually happened."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:24:58.65","Right, but it's just a first step."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","2","Act Two. Kids","subject","Michael Ignatieff","00:25:00.58","Absolutely a first step. And it would be naive to think that when the tribunal winds up its work in so many years' time, and all the volumes of evidence are published, that this is of itself going to make much difference. I mean, the really scary thing is the sense in which in a lot of Serbian society and Croatian society, the conclusions and even the evidence of the Hague are discounted before it's even heard, as being, you know, this kind of alien enemy, nobody understands this but ourselves, that kind of line. You know, no one understands the Serbs but the Serbs, no one understands the Croats but the Croats, no one understands the Muslims but the Muslims, and therefore, anything that an international tribunal says to them has to be wrong."

And so when they sit down and hold a truth commission themselves, not outsiders but they, themselves, because they are ready to reconcile and have been part of a process of reconciliation, there's a place for that truth to go. It can actually have an effect. There's a readiness for it."

The tragedy in the Balkans is that, at the moment, there's no place for the truth to go, because the regimes that are in power, all of them-- and I include the Muslim side-- are not regimes which really allow, and welcome, and let the truth circulate freely. And until they are, the Hague tribunal will be crying in the wilderness."

To come to terms with the past, do entire nations have to go through the same psychological processes that a person goes through when they face the past? In other words, does there have to be a moment of admitting the truth, of admitting guilt, of feeling shame? We look at a few of those moments, in a very different setting, in a minute, when our program continues."

"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","host","Scott Carrier","00:42:13.83","The 14-year-old told her to stop, but she did it again to another boy, and another girlfriend. So the 14-year-old girl went over to her house, pulled her by her hair off the front steps and into the yard, and punched her in the face. Her defense attorney tries to get her to say she's sorry, that she won't do it again."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Defense Attorney","00:42:32.13","Why did you do what you did?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","14-year-old Defendant","00:42:34.47","Bad temper."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Defense Attorney","00:42:37.86","What are your feelings now about what you did?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","14-year-old Defendant","00:42:41.56","It really doesn't bother me, because I did it, and can't take it back, so."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Defense Attorney","00:42:46.16","Thank you, no further questions, Your Honor."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Judge","00:42:50.45","Cross-examination."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Prosecutor","00:42:52.35","Thank you, Your Honor. You lost your temper and got into a fight, right? Because she provoked you? Now, if I walked up here like this, and I started talking massive crap to your face, would you hit me because I provoked you?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","14-year-old Defendant","00:43:05.47","Maybe."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Prosecutor","00:43:06.19","Maybe. It doesn't bother you now that you got in a fight?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","14-year-old Defendant","00:43:11.27","No."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Prosecutor","00:43:11.87","No. Why?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","14-year-old Defendant","00:43:16.48","Fighting's an everyday thing. It doesn't really make a big difference. It happens, then it's over."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Prosecutor","00:43:21.88","It happens then it's over? Everyday thing?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","14-year-old Defendant","00:43:24.68","Yeah, it's not nothing. It's not like getting shot, or stabbed, or dying. You just get a few marks, maybe."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Prosecutor","00:43:31.58","It's against the law. Whether there's a gun, a knife, or dying involved, fighting is against the law, just like smoking, just like everything else, just like killing. It's against the law. It shouldn't be done. That's why you're here today. Can you tell this jury that you're not going to fight again?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","14-year-old Defendant","00:43:49.87","No."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Prosecutor","00:43:50.83","No further questions."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","host","Scott Carrier","00:43:51.64","This trial has a different jury. When they debate, no one mentions the statement by the defendant, that in her neighborhood, fighting is an everyday thing, no big deal, really. It either just flew over their heads, or it doesn't make any difference to them."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","host","Scott Carrier","00:44:07.36","The most important thing to them is that the defendant feels no remorse, has suffered no shame. And like the first jury, somehow they're certain that shame is the essential ingredient, the first step in changing the criminal into a good citizen."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Juror 6","00:44:22.10","She doesn't feel bad about it at all, you guys, so."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Juror 7","00:44:25.93","Give her mandatory--"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Jury","00:44:27.31","Yeah, mandatory self-esteem, the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Juror 8","00:44:32.71","How many jury duties, one?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Juror 9","00:44:34.20","I think she should have more, like three."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Jury","00:44:36.39","Three, yeah, three."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Juror 7","00:44:37.42","She's got to learn from other people."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Juror 9","00:44:38.42","She doesn't even care, like, she just sits there like-- I think she should go to the self-esteem workshop a couple times."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Juror 8","00:44:44.77","You know, you can give her two self-esteem workshops."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Juror 9","00:44:47.56","Can you really?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Juror 8","00:44:47.99","Yeah, two workshops, maximum."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Juror 9","00:44:49.77","I think we should."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Jury","00:44:50.26","Oh, do that, do that."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Juror 8","00:44:51.26","Yeah, give her two."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","host","Scott Carrier","00:45:04.21","Most members of the jury have already been through the workshops. They know what the right answer is. They get excited as they write the comments to the defendants."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Juror 6","00:45:12.47","Yeah, she needs to hear it. She needs to feel somewhat bad about it."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Juror 9","00:45:16.18","OK, we feel that there will be people that lie and cheat your whole life, to you--"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Jury","00:45:22.92","But you can't beat them all up."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Juror 6","00:45:25.46","You have to grow up."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Juror 8","00:45:29.31","Use your mind, not your muscles."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","subject","Teen Juror 9","00:45:31.73","All that's good."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","host","Scott Carrier","00:45:34.38","After they deliver the sentence, the defendant comes down off the stand, and I ask if she wants to talk to me for a little bit, but she looks at me as if she'd like to rip my throat out, like, where's my knife when I need it. She's not been shamed. In her neighborhood, fighting is an everyday thing, a way of life, a way of staying alive. Nobody understood what she was saying."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","3","Act Three. Everyday Justice","host","Scott Carrier","00:46:01.77","I follow her out of the courtroom and down the hallway, to the room where she'll have her exit interview. I watch her sit down at a long wooden table, surrounded by social workers and police officers, and her body is there, but she is gone, checked out, no longer present for the proceedings. She just isn't going to listen anymore. I can go in and sit down and watch as the administrators try to see whether she understands her sentence, as they try to get through to her, but I don't."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","host","Ira Glass","00:47:05.27","Act Three, Everyday Justice. Well, the impulse to confess, to admit the truth, to state your shame, is so important and so basic that, of course, people do not need a trial to make them do it. In 1980, a New Yorker named Allan Bridge set up a telephone line he called the Apology Line. People could call and confess to anything. They were recorded. And you could call and you could listen to other people's confessions recorded on the line."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","host","Ira Glass","00:47:30.52","Over time, the whole thing turned into a little community of confession. People recorded messages responding to each other's apologies. Mr. Apology, Allan Bridge, would leave messages responding. And sometimes he would actually contact callers off the line. Here's some recordings from the line."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","subject","Caller 1","00:47:47.27","Yes, I'd like to apologize because I broke the town hall windows. I flooded the basement. I broke windows on the back of a store uptown. I feel pretty bad about it because I did so much vandalism. I'm only 16 years old. I did so much vandalism, if I was caught, I'd be in juvie hall for a pretty long time, I'd say."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","subject","Caller 1","00:48:08.27","I'm sorry for harassing the Republican officials, making the bomb threats and the death notices. I'm sorry for the terrorism, the firebombing that the guy paid me to do to some guy's house. I'm sorry for-- ah, what else?-- the burnings in the streets of Smithtown, Long Island."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","subject","Caller 1","00:48:32.71","I'm sorry for the way I'm calling right now. I'm calling by way of a phony credit card. I'm sorry for harassing the teacher in school. I feel bad about it. I'd like to have a new lease on life. What else? I'm sorry for harassing a lot of people, for causing pain to my family. I felt so sad I was sick, I was sick by it. That's all I have to say. Yeah. So long."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","subject","Caller 2","00:49:14.20","Hello, I'm Israeli. I want to apologize. I don't know if even what I did was wrong or right, but when I was in Israel six months before, I killed six Arabs at night with a gang of other Jewish settlers. And at the time, we thought we were-- I believe still, we're fighting for our homeland, to keep it from the Arabs, but perhaps now that I am here in America, I realized that maybe killing is not the right way, and I want to apologize. Thank you."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","subject","Caller 3","00:49:53.12","Yeah, I want to apologize for something. And maybe, my guess is it's too late to apologize for it, but I want to apologize for it now. My mother was bedridden for a while, and she used to get social security and welfare, and I had no job, and I had no way of making money. And when she was hungry or thirsty, I used to make her give me money to give her a drink. Like, she'd have to give me $5 for a glass of water, $10 for a sandwich."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","subject","Caller 3","00:50:27.64","And now she's passed away, and I can't say I'm sorry to her, because I know what I did was probably the most horrible thing in the world. And I'll never be able to say I'm sorry to her. And I hope I go to hell and burn there for this, because it wasn't right. And if there's somewhere that she can hear me, I just want to tell her I'm sorry. Thank you."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","subject","Caller 4","00:51:01.81","I've never told anyone this, except my shrink. I accidentally killed my younger sister when I was a very small child. And it's haunted me all my life, because I didn't really mean it. It was just a game to me. I was really too young to realize what I was doing. And I was putting her head inside a plastic garbage bag and putting a rubber band around her neck, just to see her face turn blue. And I guess it was a lot of fun."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","subject","Caller 4","00:51:33.68","And I didn't mean anything bad to happen, but I guess I didn't realize what would happen if I did this too long. And she suffocated. And I hid the plastic bag, and I went out of the house. My parents weren't home. And they never found out. They thought it was crib death, they never found out I did it."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","subject","Caller 4","00:52:05.74","And you know, I've never been able to tell them. I think it would hurt them worse than losing her, to find out that I did it. I kind of wish my parents could hear this tape, but I guess they never will."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","subject","Caller 5","00:52:34.26","Hi. I'm a runaway, and all I want to say is that I'm kind of sorry that I left. See, I'm 15, and I saw your number in the newspaper. And when I saw it, I had to call, because it's like, I mean, you walk around on the streets all day long, just looking for someone who just might say, hey, want a place to go? Come with me. There could be food and everything. And they won't ask for anything back. That's all I want. I guess I take up too much time on the tape, but I've just got to talk."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","host","Ira Glass","00:53:44.42","The Apology Line doesn't exist anymore. Mr. Apology, Allan Bridge, died in August of 1995. When he did, the line was deluged with hundreds of messages from its regular callers, grieving. His wife Marissa says it was never clear what the Apology Line had meant to people. For years, people had used it to talk about all sorts of experiences."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","subject","Marissa Bridge","00:54:04.01","I think that maybe the word apology means something bigger than just saying you're sorry. Or at least, maybe not the word, but the line came to mean to people a place where one could go and bring their feelings, to confess, not necessarily about doing something wrong, but to confess about having a feeling."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:54:25.94","When he was alive, would you ever call the line, or be tempted to call the line?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","subject","Marissa Bridge","00:54:30.55","I called the line in the beginning. When I first knew him, before I moved in with him, I called the line from time to time."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:54:36.68","And you'd apologize for stuff?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","subject","Marissa Bridge","00:54:38.74","Well, yeah, sometimes, but more to get his attention than anything else. So he wouldn't forget about me up in Washington Heights, where I was living."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:54:49.70","What would you apologize for back then? Do you remember what you would say?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","subject","Marissa Bridge","00:54:52.92","They were all like, you know, just to get his attention. Things like, I'm really sorry I was flirting with another guy, or something like that, all very much part of the mating game."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:55:05.00","And once you actually had a real relationship with him, you wouldn't call the line, and you didn't feel the need to ever?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","subject","Marissa Bridge","00:55:11.95","No, but one thing that really struck me was after he died, I really turned into an Apology Line caller, someone I would define as Apology Line caller. And the line was over, so when I really needed the line, it wasn't there."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","subject","Marissa Bridge","00:55:28.12","I was just completely lost, and I would have loved to have been able to call the Apology Line and have someone like Allan on the other side, very sympathetic and understanding, to help me get through it. But unfortunately, that didn't happen. So I'm a much darker person than I was before he died, and I think that I understand the callers and the line much better than I even did before."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:55:54.09","He died in this scuba accident where he was hit by a jet skier, who then fled the scene and wasn't caught. Have you thought about the kinds of people who would call the line, who used to call the line all the time, who had done bad things to other people, and hurt other people, and you know, then would flee the scene and nobody would ever know? Have you thought about those jet skiers in terms of that, in terms of the people who used to call the line?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","subject","Marissa Bridge","00:56:17.52","Yes. In fact, the person that hit him would also be a prime candidate for the Apology Line, because we think that he knew that he did something, because there were witnesses that saw the accident, and they saw someone on a jet ski hit him, they circled around once and then took off, so yeah."
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:56:39.92","But you can imagine those people actually calling the line. If they would've called the line, if the line had existed for them, what would've happened? What would Mr. Apology have said if he were around to say it?"
"48","Justice","1997-01-03","4","Act 3","subject","Marissa Bridge","00:56:53.22","I think he would be pretty pissed off, but he would forgive them. I think that's how he would have gone for it. I think he would have been angry that he was hit. That was a total accident, but I think that if they would have apologized for hitting him, he would have forgiven them, because I think that forgiveness was a big part of his personality. I think he really believed in the power of forgiveness, and everyone can be forgiven if they're sorry. I think that's something that he really believed in."
