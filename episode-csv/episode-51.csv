"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:00.78","It's delicate. It's beautiful. Sandy pulls out a handwritten page that's maybe three inches by five, tiny, black, perfect letters with brilliant orange and blue highlights on thin parchment."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","subject","Sandy Hindman","00:00:14.51","Look at how thin this is."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:00:16.93","This is a page from another book--"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","subject","Sandy Hindman","00:00:18.38","This is a page from a 13th century Parisian Bible. And there are hundreds, thousands of these. It was the required book for the University of Paris. There were thousands and thousands of students and professors at the University of Paris over several centuries."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:00:38.86","And what's really amazing about it is that the writing is in two columns, and it looks too small to actually have been written by a human hand."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","subject","Sandy Hindman","00:00:44.96","They invented eyeglasses in the 13th century."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:52.55","Sandy is Sandy Hindman, director of an art gallery across from the Louvre that sells Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts, head of the art history department at Northwestern University. The reason she knows so much about manuscripts, she tells me, is that she doesn't know anything about anything else."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","subject","Sandy Hindman","00:01:09.81","So they're written all-- like, all, 99.9% of the manuscripts of the Middle Ages are written on parchment. And parchment is animal skin."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:26.90","Animal skin. Cows, goats, cats. And in the case of the delicate perfect page that she showed me, probably--"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","subject","Sandy Hindman","00:01:37.07","This would be, like, a rat. If you take a whole rat, like this big, sort of the size of what--"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:01:45.98","You're holding your hands about a foot apart."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","subject","Sandy Hindman","00:01:47.19","--a foot apart, and you skin it, that makes a bifolium, which is two of these pages. So that's what you would get. And then you'd have to get 600 of those animals to get a book."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:02:08.21","So we're thinking 600 rats, 600 cats, maybe."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","subject","Sandy Hindman","00:02:11.11","Or squirrels or cats. The idea of cats has come up recently because they found all these cat bones, like a mound of cat bones, like a huge mound, like a burial site of cat bones right near the Seine where all the book-- where all the little book shops are now on the Seine, that's exactly where they were in the 15th century."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:39.47","Looking at these manuscripts with Sandy, I was really struck by just how complete our dominion is over the animal world, you know? That we could slaughter 300 cats or squirrels or rats or anything just to make this one little, little book."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","subject","Sandy Hindman","00:03:02.16","Now an eighth century book, like The Book of Kells, they say represented a herd of cattle. A Gutenberg Bible, like the first book ever printed is called the Gutenberg Bible, because he invented printing in 1452. So a Gutenberg Bible, each of those was a herd of cattle."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:03:26.95","I think, what would Norman Mailer do, you know? Or David Foster Wallace, what would they do if a couple paragraphs, four paragraphs maybe, you can fit on these tiny pages, if that required the death of, you know, a cow or a cat for every single copy of one of their books? You know, it's no wonder that most of the books back then were religious. What human writing could seem worth it?"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:03:55.05","What do we know, if anything, about attitudes in the Middle Ages towards killing off that many animals?"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","1","Prologue","subject","Sandy Hindman","00:04:00.37","I mean, I don't know anything really. I mean, my guess would be that since there are tons of colophons, that is, little inscriptions in the back, saying ""Oh, I'm so pleased to have done this for you, God. This was wonderful. It was worth all the time."" So probably they thought that it was great for the animal too. The animal was serving God just like they were by being in a book."

"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","2","Act One. I'm Ferdinand. I'm Glad to be Your Steak Tonight","host","Ira Glass","00:05:26.14","Act One. What do we choose to believe about the sacrifices that animals make for us? Well, Jay Allison came up with this answer to that question."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","2","Act One. I'm Ferdinand. I'm Glad to be Your Steak Tonight","host","Ira Glass","00:05:38.93","When they came off of the ark, before they would disperse, remember, he said, God said to him, ""Every beast of the field and fowl of the air shall become food unto you from this day on."""
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","2","Act One. I'm Ferdinand. I'm Glad to be Your Steak Tonight","host","Jay Allison","00:05:52.25","A friend of mine, a classical pianist I know, had a dream that he was sleeping in his own room when something woke him up. Gathering at the foot of his bed was every animal he had ever even. They were just looking at him, breathing quietly. They pushed in closer and closer around his bed as more kept coming. Then when the room was full, the ones that came first started to file out through the bathroom door. And for the rest of the dream, each animal in turn simply paused by my friend's bed, looked at him, and passed on by to make room for the next one."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","2","Act One. I'm Ferdinand. I'm Glad to be Your Steak Tonight","subject","Woman","00:06:32.91","I went to the slaughterhouses and I went out to the cattle ranches and places like that. And I talked to the animals, because I wanted to know if this was a really traumatic thing. It's like, I experience what the animal experiences. It's a vicarious experience. I feel their emotions. I think their thoughts. I literally become that animal. They show me what they look at, and what they see in life. And then I see it as they perceive it."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","2","Act One. I'm Ferdinand. I'm Glad to be Your Steak Tonight","subject","Slaughterhouse Man","00:07:08.58","That door slides up. They come in here, and we kill them here. We lift this gate here, then the animal rolls out down here, and we put a chain around her leg. We use this chain the, put it right around her leg, a hind leg and pick them up."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","2","Act One. I'm Ferdinand. I'm Glad to be Your Steak Tonight","subject","Woman","00:07:32.93","So when I was there and I asked them how they felt, and they said they didn't mind giving their life for a purpose. And I watched the ones that were lifted upside down, where they tie them up by the back legs and then they slit the throat and the animal dies."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","2","Act One. I'm Ferdinand. I'm Glad to be Your Steak Tonight","subject","Slaughterhouse Man","00:07:53.69","We roll them over here and cut their throat, let the blood out of them."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","2","Act One. I'm Ferdinand. I'm Glad to be Your Steak Tonight","subject","Woman","00:08:00.27","They bleed to death. Well, I stood there and watched it, because I had to know if this was cruel. And those animals felt a lot of pain, but it was only like 30 seconds. And then, because they were upside down, all the organs pushed towards it. They cut off the blood supply. And the animals, when they actually had their throats cut, they were numb."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","2","Act One. I'm Ferdinand. I'm Glad to be Your Steak Tonight","subject","Slaughterhouse Man","00:08:20.98","Roll them on across, lay them down in the cradles. Take their legs off, pick them up, and eviscerate them, split them down in the back then. Gives us two halves."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","2","Act One. I'm Ferdinand. I'm Glad to be Your Steak Tonight","subject","Woman","00:08:37.50","People say, ""Oh, I couldn't see an animal die."" Well, most of those animals wouldn't even live if it hadn't been for the fact that they were going to be raised for food. They wouldn't have even been born."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","2","Act One. I'm Ferdinand. I'm Glad to be Your Steak Tonight","subject","Slaughterhouse Man","00:08:47.17","And they're rolled out into the cutting room and cut up into steaks, roasts, ground beef, then wrapped. Each package is labeled, and then we put it in the freezer."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","2","Act One. I'm Ferdinand. I'm Glad to be Your Steak Tonight","subject","Woman","00:09:05.20","You know, the animals tell me, most of the ones that are raised for food are raised very humanely. They're given the best of food, they're given the best of care. But they told me, no, that they felt that this was a purpose in life they were fulfilling. And they understood it, and they accepted the role because they were not afraid to die."

Well, animals and the death of animals are not the main point of this next story, but they do help define the moral universe of the story. This is a story by George Saunders. A quick warning. There is nothing explicit, there's no nasty language, nothing like that in this story. But, but, but, some references and ideas might not be suitable for some children."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","3","Act Two. The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:11:11.38","At noon, another load of raccoons comes in, and Claude takes them out back of the office and executes them with a tire iron. Then he checks for vitals wearing protective gloves. Then he drags the cage across 209 and initiates burial by dumping the raccoons into the pit that's our little corporate secret. After burial comes prayer, a personal touch that never fails to irritate Tim, our ruthless CEO."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","3","Act Two. The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:11:34.20","Before founding Humane Raccoon Alternatives, Tim purposely backed his car over a frat boy and got 10 to 12 for manslaughter. In jail, he earned his MBA by designing and marketing a line of light-up Halloween lapel broaches. Now he gives us the broaches as performance incentives and sporadically trashes a bookshelf or two to remind us of his awesome temper and of how ill-advised we'd be to cross him in any way whatsoever."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","3","Act Two. The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:12:05.10","Post-burial, I write up the invoices and a paragraph or two on how overjoyed the raccoons were when we set them free. Sometimes I'll throw in something about spontaneous mating beneath the box elders. No one writes a better misleading letter than me. In the area of phone inquiries, I'm also unsurpassed. When a client calls to ask how their release went, everyone in the office falls all over themselves transferring the call to me. I'm reassuring and joyful. I laugh until tears run down my face at the stories I make up regarding the wacky things their raccoon did upon gaining its freedom."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","3","Act Two. The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:12:37.35","Then, as per Tim, I ask if they'd mind sending back our promotional materials. The brochures don't come cheap. They show glossies of raccoons in the wild contrasted with glossies of poisoned raccoons in their death throes. You lay that on a housewife with perennially knocked-over trash cans and she breathes a sigh of relief. Then she hires you and you get a 10% commission."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","3","Act Two. The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:13:06.20","These days, commissions are my main joy. I'm too large to attract female company. I weigh 400. I don't like it, but it's beyond my control. I've tried running and rowing the stationary canoe and Hatha yoga and belly staples and even a muzzle back in the dark days when I had it bad for Frieda, our document placement and retrieval specialist. When I was merely portly, it was easy to see myself as a kind of exuberant sportsman who overate out of lust for life. Now, no one could possibly mistake me for a sportsman."

Claude comes in all dirty from the burial and sees me snacking and feels compelled to point out that even my sub-rolls have sub-rolls. He's right, but still it isn't nice to say. Tim asks did Claude make that observation after having wild sex with me all night? That's a comment I'm not fond of, but Tim's the boss. His T-shirt says, ""I hold your purse strings in my hot, little hand."""
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","3","Act Two. The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:14:09.69","""Haha, Tim,"" says Claude. ""I'm no homo. But if I was one, I'd die before doing it with Mr. Lard."""

My colleagues leave hippo refrigerator magnets on my seat. They imply that I'm a despondent virgin, which I'm not. They might change their tune if they ever spoke with Ellen Burtomly regarding the beautiful night we spent at her brother Bob's cottage. I was by no means slim then but could at least buy pants off the rack and walk from the den to the kitchen without panting. I remember her nude at the window and the lovely seed helicopters blowing in as she turned and showed me her ample front on purpose."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","3","Act Two. The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:14:49.38","That was my most romantic moment. Now for that kind of thing, it's the degradation of Larney's Consenting Adult Viewing Center. Before it started getting to me, I'd bring boot-loads of quarters and a special bottom cushion and watch hours and hours of Scandinavian women romping. It was shameful. Finally, last Christmas, I said enough is enough. I'd rather be sexless than evil. And since then, I have been. Sexless and good, but very, very tense."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","3","Act Two. The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:15:22.89","Since then, I've tried to live above the fray. I've tried to minimize my physical aspects and be a selfless force for good. When mocked, which is nearly every day, I recall Christ covered with spittle. When filled with lust, I remember Gandhi purposely sleeping next to a sexy teen to test himself. After work, I go home, watch a little TV, maybe say a rosary or two. 30 more years of this and I'm out of it without hurting anybody or embarrassing myself."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","3","Act Two. The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:16:03.29","Sadly, I find my feelings for Frieda returning. I must have a death wish. Clearly I repulse her. Sometimes I catch her looking at my gut overhangs with a screwed-up face. I see her licking her lips while typing and certain unholy thoughts go through my head. I hear her speaking tenderly on the phone to her little son Len and can't help picturing myself sitting on a specially reinforced porch swing while she fries up some chops and Len digs in the muck."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","3","Act Two. The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:16:29.64","Today as we prepare a mailer, she says she's starting to want to be home with Len all the time. But there's the glaring problem of funds. She makes squat. I've seen her stub. There's the further problem that she suspects Mrs. Rasputin, Len's babysitter, is a lush. ""I don't know what to do,"" Frieda says. I come home after work and she's sitting there tipsy in her bra, fanning herself with a racing form. Before I know what I'm saying, I suggest that perhaps we should go out for dinner and offer each other some measure of comfort."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","3","Act Two. The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:16:58.44","In response, she spits her Tab out across her cubicle. She says now she's heard it all. She goes to fetch Tim and Claude so they can join her in guffawing at my nerve. She faxes a comical note about my arrogance to her girlfriend at the DMV. All afternoon, she keeps looking at me with her head cocked. Needless to say, it's a long day."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","3","Act Two. The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:17:18.24","Then at 5:00, after everyone else is gone, she comes shyly by and says she'd love to go out with me. She says I've always been there for her. She says she likes a man with a little meat on his bones. She says pick her up at 8:00 and bring something for Len. I'm shocked. I'm overjoyed. My knees are nearly shaking my little desk apart."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","3","Act Two. The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:17:38.14","I buy Len a football helmet and a baseball glove and an aquarium and a set of encyclopedias. I basically clean out my pitiful savings.

One tiny eyebrow cocks up at my physical appearance. Then he crawls into my lap holding his Mega Death Dealer by the cowl. What a sweet boy. The Dealer's got a severed human head in its hand. When you pull the string, the Dealer cries, ""You're dead and I've killed you, Prince of Slime,"" and sticks its Day-Glo tongue out. I give Len my anti-violence spiel. I tell him only love can dispel hate. I tell him we were meant to live in harmony and give one another emotional support. He looks at me blankly then flings his Death Dealer at the cat."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","3","Act Two. The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:18:58.14","Frieda comes down looking sweet and casts a baleful eye on Mrs. Rasputin and away we go. I take her to Ace's Volcano Island. Ace's is an old service station now done up Hawaiian. They've got a tape loop of surf sounds and some Barbies in grass skirts climbing a paper mache mountain. I purposely starve myself."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","3","Act Two. The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:19:17.44","We talk about her life philosophy. We talk about her hair style and her treasured childhood memories and her paranormally gifted aunt. I fail to get a word in edgewise, and that's fine. I like listening. I like learning about her.

"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","3","Act Two. The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:19:43.06","I walk her home. Kids in doorways whistle at my width. I handle it with grace by shaking my rear. Frieda laughs. A kiss seems viable. It all feels too good to be true. Then on her porch, she shakes my hand and says great, she can now pay her phone bill, courtesy of Tim. She shows me the written agreement. It says, ""In consideration of your consenting to be seen in public with Jeffrey, I, Tim, will pay you, Frieda, the sum of $50."""

If only I could say to my heart, ""Give up. Be alone forever. There's always opera. There's angel food cake and neighborhood children caroling and the look of autumn leaves on a wet roof."" But no. My heart's some kind of idiotic fishing bobber. My invoices go very well. The sun sinks, the moon rises, brown and pale as my stupid face."

The Carlisles are rich. A poor guy has a raccoon problem, he sprinkles poison in his trash and calls it a day. Not the Carlisles. They dominate bread routes throughout the city. Carlisle supposedly strong-armed his way to the top of the bread heap, but in person, he's nice enough."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","3","Act Two. The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:22:00.94","I let him observe me laying out the rotten fruit. I show him how the cage door coming down couldn't hurt a flea. Then he goes inside and I wait patiently in my car. Just after midnight, I trip the wire. I fetch the Carlisles and encourage them to squat down and relate to the captured raccoon. Then I recite our canned speech congratulating them for their advance thinking. I describe the wilderness where the release will take place, the streams and fertile valleys, the romp in the raccoon's stride when it catches its first whiff of pristine air."

I tell him that's my job. Just then, the raccoon's huge mate bolts out of the woods and tears into my calf. I struggle to my car and kick the mate repeated against my wheel well until it dies with my leg in its mouth. The Carlisles stand aghast in the carport. I stand aghast in the driveway, sick at heart. I've trapped my share of raccoons and helped Claude with more burials than I care to remember, but I've never actually killed anything before."

The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:23:03.68","I throw both coons in the trunk and drive myself to the emergency room, where I'm given the first of a series of extremely painful shots. I doze off on a bench post-treatment and dream of a den of pathetic baby raccoons in V-neck sweaters yelping for food. When I wake up, I call in. Tim asks if I'm crazy kicking a raccoon to death in front of clients. Couldn't I have gently lifted it off, he asks, or offered it some rotting fruit? Am I proud of my ability to screw up one-car funerals?"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","3","Act Two. The 400 Pound CEO","host","George Saunders","00:23:31.20","I tell Tim I'm truly sorry I didn't handle the situation more effectively. He says the raccoon must've had a said last couple of minutes once it realized it had given up its life for the privilege of gnawing on a shank of pure fat. That hurts. Why I continue to expect decent treatment from someone who's installed a torture chamber in the corporate basement is beyond me. Down there, he's got a Hide-A-Bed and a whip collection and an executioner's mask with a built-in Walkman. Sometimes when I'm invoicing late, he'll bring in one of his willing victims. Usually, they're both wasto."

Talk about some father somewhere being crestfallen if he knew what his daughter was up to. Once I peeked out as they left and saw a blonde with a black eye going wherever Tim pointed and picking up his coat whenever he purposely dropped it. How do people get like this? I thought. Can they change back? Can they learn again to love and be gentle? How can they look at themselves in the mirror or hang Christmas ornaments without overflowing with self-loathing?"

The next day, Tim was inducted into Rotary and we all went to the luncheon. He spoke on turning one's life around. He spoke on the bitter lessons of incarceration. He sang the praises of America and joked with balding, sweetheart ophthalmologists and after lunch hung his Rotary plaque in the torture chamber stairwell and ordered me to Windex it daily or face extremely grim consequences."

We drag the cage into a shrub and squat, panting. Claude whispers that I smell. He whispers that if he weighed 400, he'd take into account that people around him and go on a diet. A pale girl in a sari gets out of the car and walks to the lip of the pit. She paces off the circumference and scribbles in a notebook. She takes photos. She slides down on her rear and comes back up with some coon bones in a baggy. After she leaves, we rush back to the office."

He says the next time she shows up, he may have to teach her a lesson about jeopardizing our meal ticket. He says animal rights are all well and good, but there's a big difference between a cute bunny or cat and a disgusting raccoon that thrives on carrion and trash and creates significant sanitation problems with its inquisitiveness."

"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:45:36.85","Hey, buddy, do you see a dead cat laying around anywhere?"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Man","00:45:39.93","A cat?"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:45:40.80","Yeah."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","host","Ira Glass","00:45:42.16","At one house, we were supposed to find a cat. But after looking in the street, in the backyard, everywhere, we only found a fish, 10 inches long, silver blue, in perfect condition, but dead."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:45:53.11","Maybe they got confused."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:45:54.33","Maybe so."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","host","Ira Glass","00:45:56.49","We had other stops. A cat under a tree, a dog covered with maggots. Over on 30th Place, we were called out for a squirrel."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:46:07.01","There it is."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:46:07.55","There it is, right there."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","host","Ira Glass","00:46:10.50","It took less than a minute."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:46:14.51","Then I take him and put him in the truck here. After we get two put in the truck, we put it down. Then we go to the next stop. Pick up just--"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","host","Ira Glass","00:46:25.26","People have strong personal reactions to dead animals. A stranger wearing a white cap and a beeper just walked up to us and started talking."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Man 2","00:46:34.05","I'd have given half my life for that squirrel at one time. I was a prisoner during the Korean War. And I used to sit up off that Han River and watch seagulls fly over. I'd be laying there thinking I could fry one, that's how hungry I was. What, are you just riding around?"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:46:50.11","Yeah."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Man 2","00:46:51.51","You know, animals got a right. We're killing most of them because we forced them off their land. I think they have as much right on Earth as man has, or human beings. And we forced them off. In fact, they were here first."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:47:03.55","Are you the person who called it in to the Department of Sanitation to pick this up?"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Man 2","00:47:06.04","I saw it. Yeah. They'll be here in a short period of time. They'll pick up that before they pick up most human beings."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","host","Ira Glass","00:47:15.33","Back in the truck, Mr. Hicks said that in his job, you can't just throw the animals around. People will complain. You have to respect people's feelings about animals, be more funeral director than garbage man. Like yesterday, he said, when he picked up a woman's dog."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:47:29.68","Yeah, she was really, really crying. It's a sad thing to see people really crying. And you'll be surprised about the animals. People are really crazy about animals."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:47:38.27","What was this animal yesterday?"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:47:40.04","It was a great big dog. A German Shepherd. And she really got attached to it."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:47:43.46","So what did you do? What did you say?"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:47:45.75","I just said, well, I'm sorry you lost your dog. She just cried. So I asked her were you going to get another one? She said, I don't know. I might. I might get a dog. I don't know. So that's about the size of what you could do. So I just put him on the truck, onto the next stop."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:48:01.49","This is a big black dog."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:48:02.47","A big dog. A big black dog."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","host","Ira Glass","00:48:04.90","The next stop for us was the animal shelter, where ordinary people bring their animals to be put to sleep, as they say. Mr. Hicks and another animal man, William Daniels, put on aprons and gloves and carried five big, gray, plastic barrels of animals into the truck, 50 or 60 animals in all."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:48:23.24","And that garbage bucket had a couple of dogs, a couple cats."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:48:27.60","Cats, dogs--"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","William Daniels","00:48:27.96","Dogs, cats, rats, squirrels, possums, all that."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:48:33.20","And now another dog."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:48:35.20","Another big dog."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","William Daniels","00:48:35.60","Big German Shepherd here."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","host","Ira Glass","00:48:37.47","All the animals are taken to what Mr. Hicks calls ""The Box,"" a walk-in freezer near the city incinerator. There, the animals are lifted into metal oil barrels and left."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:48:48.84","Has this job changed the way that you see animals?"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:48:54.63","To me? No. To me, they're dead, they're dead. There's no change in--"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:48:58.22","Come on. I don't believe you. I feel like I see animals differently just from seeing those dogs in one of those gray, plastic--"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:49:04.74","How do you see them dead? Are you seeing them decomposed? You know they're dead, right?"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:49:07.50","Well, that's a new point of view."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:49:08.92","OK, they'll be decomposed, you know they ain't alive, because if they were alive they'd be still running around here."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:49:13.50","I'll tell you, the next time I see a dog on the street, I'm going to think to myself-- I'm just going to remember what those dogs in the back of your truck looked like."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:49:18.92","Well, they looked dead, right?"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:49:20.25","They looked dead, yeah."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:49:21.08","OK. You know they are not alive. Because if they were alive, they'd be running around. If you see a live dog, you say, well, you be careful now, because one day, you may be back in the back there."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:49:31.00","Did you ever see those pictures of-- I guess it's the angel of death? You know, big black hood and a sickle, a guy holding a sickle? The Grim Reaper."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:49:41.50","I've seen a picture of that guy. [INAUDIBLE] Why should I let that bother me?"
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:49:45.03","Well, it shouldn't bother you because that's who you are for these dogs."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:49:47.55","That's right."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:49:48.49","That's you."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:49:49.43","Well, no, I'm the angel. See, when they die, I'm going to take them to heaven. I'm the undertaker. I'm the undertaker. Keep them from laying on the streets, smelling, let birds pick on them and all that kind eat him or something like that. I take them off the street."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:50:10.36","Give them a decent disposal."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","subject","Clarence Hicks","00:50:11.63","There you go."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","4","Act Three. Dead Animal Man","host","Ira Glass","00:50:14.05","A few times a week, a rendering company comes down from Baltimore to pick up the animals that Mr. Hicks has gathered and left in The Box. In Baltimore, these smelly creatures that nobody wants are changed into smelly things that people sell to each other, ingredients for perfume, fertilizer, stuff that ordinary folks can handle themselves."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","5","Act Four. Redemption","host","Ira Glass","00:52:09.50","Act Four, Redemption. So what if you took it as your mission to keep the animals from dying? Well, the hardest cases, the most abused, the sickest animals in trouble are Leo Brillo's purpose in life."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","5","Act Four. Redemption","subject","Leo Brillo","00:52:22.54","I guess I can't stand the suffering of an animal. An animal looks up at you, and to me, I can feel what he's feeling as a human little thing. Or there's something going on. I don't just see a furry thing. I see the eyes and I get right into the feelings of the animal. And something affects me and I have to do something about it. I don't have that empathy, maybe, with people. Or maybe I don't allow it, to have that with people. Because somehow people can take care of themselves. These guys can't. These animals can't. So I see that and I have to do something about it. But I won't draw the line."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","5","Act Four. Redemption","subject","Leo Brillo","00:52:54.45","See, I can't go to the pound. I have meetings with the director, the whole set up out here. I can't go to the pound. He has to meet me in a coffee shop. Because if I go to the pound, I'm going to walk through, look at every animal, take every dog that's ready to be killed that day and bring them to the shelter. I can't do that. But I will. So for me, I know the weakness. The weakness is don't communicate. Don't be there. Just be removed. I can't go over the next hill if I don't have the room."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","5","Act Four. Redemption","subject","Leo Brillo","00:53:20.53","Still, there's just this thing inside of me that pulls me and I go into the next hill. And I find things all the time. I always find somebody when I do that. And this is my code. And this is the way I live. My one message to animals is if you're hungry or if you're hurt, cross my path. That's my message. And since the day I said that, I was in Hollywood, I told you, and I'm walking down the street and cats are jumping out in front of me ever since then."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","5","Act Four. Redemption","subject","Leo Brillo","00:53:47.28","I mean, my friends, nobody has this problem. I go down the street and they pop out of everywhere. And they're limping or they're hungry or whatever. And that makes me feel OK that I don't have to worry about did I miss one. Because I'll say, no, he's OK because he didn't cross my path."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","5","Act Four. Redemption","subject","Leo Brillo","00:54:03.30","And it is the same way, it's the same thing when you have one that's very sick, making the same decision. You tell me, what am I supposed to do? I don't want you to suffer, but if you can make it, and do you want to make it, and all these other things being considered. And still, even then, it has to be suffering with absolutely no prognosis."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","5","Act Four. Redemption","subject","Leo Brillo","00:54:24.22","I have a dog at home that I got and it had distemper. It ended up this dog lost the use of its rear legs. The vet said put her down. No way, she lost the front legs. Now I'm carrying her in and out five times, six times a day. At night, I'm waking up twice to flip her over because she can't move. She had a heating pad on. She couldn't regulate her heat."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","5","Act Four. Redemption","subject","Leo Brillo","00:54:46.49","Everybody except my wife that heard about it said it's insane. We just stopped letting people know. The vet said, ""How'd that dog do?"" I said, ""Oh, we put her down."" I didn't tell them. Six weeks, I did this, back and forth. Because she wanted to make it. There was just something about her. One day, when I'm bouncing her up and down on her feet so she can get muscle tone, I'm bouncing her, and she's just limp. And all of a sudden, a foot goes out to get her balance."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","5","Act Four. Redemption","subject","Leo Brillo","00:55:11.46","And it was the best thing-- Bailey put a foot out. Two weeks later, she could walk. Now she's running, tearing up. We've had her a year and a half now of tearing up everything. I mean, she's just-- she always remembers that she was appealing to live. And she just needed somebody to give her the chance. I give them everything I can if they want to make it. If they want to live, there's something about it, they fight. I fight with them."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","5","Act Four. Redemption","subject","Leo Brillo","00:55:39.10","I have a cat at home. He had leukemia. He got cancer, he got lymphosarcoma. He has tumors and he's building up with fluid. And we did a special new surgery. We put a tube inside him. And twice a day, I use that tube to pull fluid out of him. He's in no pain and he purrs constantly. He just purrs and purrs and purrs, and he eats. And the most important thing is to make him well. And even then, it's only for a few months. I mean, you know he's going to get it eventually. And I said, it's amazing, but we only really pay that kind of attention and that kind of devotion to them when they're in that kind of trouble."
"51","Animals Die, People Ponder","1997-01-24","5","Act Four. Redemption","subject","Leo Brillo","00:56:19.48","That could be it. My wife has another answer. She says when they're that close to death, they become perfect. And that's the attraction. I don't know. They're becoming-- they know more. All of a sudden, they know. They know what's going on. They know here and beyond and they know what the hell we're doing caught up in the middle of the two. And they know something. And whatever it is, it changes them. And they become worth more if that's possible. I don't know. Just give them every shot. And let me see what's going on out there."
