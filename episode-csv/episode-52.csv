"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","1","Prologue","subject","Dara","00:00:09.04","And they told us not to get involved and that just made it even more fun to get involved. He was very funny. He was so funny. He just made me laugh all the time. And he was really fun to be with."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:30.26","Things continued, even after they got out of the hospital. He was officially diagnosed as manic depressive. But he was manic a lot. She was depressive."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","1","Prologue","subject","Dara","00:00:40.79","I guess we complemented each other in a way. But he was-- whoa. He was whacked, man. He'd be in my apartment. He'd be walking like a chicken and stuff. And I don't know. He did anything to make me laugh."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","1","Prologue","subject","Dara","00:01:01.45","We were kind of on and off and then we decided to live together. He's a little different. I mean, I liked the crazy part of him. I liked that funny, wacky. But then, it's weird. It's different when you're living with it. It's like you have the stand up comedian with you 24 hours. It gets to be a little like snap out of it, can't you act normal? Can't you just act mellow? And no. No, that wasn't happening."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:33.00","It wasn't happening because he was after all, mentally ill."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","1","Prologue","subject","Dara","00:01:41.50","He was just driving me crazy. Because also, we would be in the grocery store and it would take him so long to buy one item. He'd be looking at it, and then comparing it to another one. And then to another one. And then he was smart, so he'd be figuring everything out mathematically. And then by grams and stuff. And I would be like no way. I can't handle this anymore. I just couldn't do it."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","1","Prologue","subject","Dara","00:02:23.59","For some reason he also thought-- he also treated me like I was the crazy one. I always thought he was crazy, I guess. So I don't think that worked."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:40.79","Although there are plenty of people with severe and debilitating mental illness just as often the line between crazy and not crazy is blurry. So many different kinds of behavior fall into both categories. And I think what captures our attention and our hearts when we talk with someone who's mentally ill, is not how they're different from us, but how they're the same."

And the tape is designed to simulate what it is that they hear. Act Three, Plague of Tics. David Sedaris explains the voices that he hears in his head. Act Four, You Don't Have to Be Crazy to Work Here, But It Helps. What it's like if you hold the keys to the asylum, but your grip on them is not too steady. Stay with us."

"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:04:31.11","One day a second Lisa arrived. We called her buy her full name, Lisa Cody, to distinguish her from the real Lisa, who remained named simply, Lisa, like a queen."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:04:42.07","The Lisas became friends. One of their favorite activities was having phone conversations. The three phone booths near the double locked double doors were our only privacy. We could go in one and shut the door. Even the craziest person could sit in a phone booth and have a private conversation, though only with herself. The nurses had lists of permitted numbers for each of us. When we picked up the phone, a nurse would answer."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:05:06.55","Hello, we'd say. This is Georgina, or Cynthia, or Polly. I want to call 555-4270."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:05:13.67","That's not on your list the nurse would say. Then the line would go dead. But there was still the quiet dusty phone booth and the old fashioned black receiver with its sharp, dorsal ridge."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:05:25.33","The Lisas had phone conversations. Each one got in a booth, folded the door shut and yelled into her receiver. When the nurse answered, Lisa yelled, ""Off the line!"" Then the Lisas got on with their conversation. Sometimes they yelled insults. Sometimes they yelled about their plans for the day."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:05:42.84","""Want to go over to the cafeteria for dinner?"" Lisa Cody would yell."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:05:46.31","But Lisa was restricted to the ward, so she'd have to yell back something like, ""Why do you want to eat that slop with all those psychotics?"""
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:05:53.41","To which Lisa Cody would yell, ""What do you think you are?"""

"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:06:12.34","Cynthia was depressive. Polly and Georgina were schizophrenic. I had a character disorder. Sometimes they called it a personality disorder."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:06:20.64","When I got my diagnosis, it didn't sound serious. But after a while, it sounded more ominous than other people's. I imagine my character as a plate or shirt that had been manufactured incorrectly and was therefore useless. When she had been with us a month or so, Lisa Cody got a diagnosis. She was a sociopath too. She was happy because she wanted to be like Lisa in all things."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:06:43.98","Lisa was not so happy because she had been the only sociopath among us. We are very rare, she told me once. And mostly, we are men."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:06:53.92","After Lisa Cody got her diagnosis, the Lisas started making more trouble. Acting out, the nurses said. We knew what it was. The real Lisa was proving that Lisa Cody wasn't a sociopath."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:07:06.98","Lisa tongued her sleeping meds for a week, took them all at once and stayed zonked for a day and a night. Lisa Cody managed to save only four of hers. And when she took them, she puked."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:07:17.62","Lisa put a cigarette out on her arm at 6:30 in the morning while the nurses were changing shifts. That afternoon, Lisa Cody burned a tiny welt on her wrist and spent the next 20 minutes running cold water on it."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:07:29.35","Then they had a life history battle. Lisa wormed out of Lisa Cody that she'd grown up in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""Greenwich, Connecticut,"" she sneered. ""No sociopath could emerge from there. Were you a debutante too?"""
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:07:43.10","Speed, black beauties, coke, heroine, Lisa had done it all. Lisa Cody said she'd been a junkie too. She rolled her sleeve back to show her tracks. Faint scratches along the vein as if once, years before, she had tangled with a rose bush."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:07:58.69","""A suburban junkie,"" said Lisa. ""You were playing that's what."""
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:08:03.30","""Hey, man. Junk's junk,"" Lisa Cody protested."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:08:06.62","Lisa pushed her sleeve up to her elbow and shoved her arm under Lisa Cody's nose.

"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:08:30.77","Lisa Cody was beaten, but she didn't have the sense to give up. She still sat beside Lisa at breakfast and hall meeting. She still waited in the phone booth for the call that didn't come."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:08:41.17","""I gotta get rid of her,"" said Lisa."

"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:08:52.58","One evening when the nurses walked the halls at dusk to turn on the lights that made our ward as bright and jarring as a penny arcade, they found every light bulb gone. Not broken, vanished. We knew who'd done it. The question was, where had she put them? It was hard to search in the darkness. Even the light bulbs in our rooms were gone."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:09:13.59","""Lisa has the true artistic temperament,"" said Georgina."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:09:16.93","""Just hunt,"" said the head nurse. ""Everybody hunt."""
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:09:20.05","Lisa sat out the hunt in the TV room. It was Lisa Cody who found them as she was meant to. She was probably planning to sit out the hunt as well, in the place that held memories of better days. She must've felt some resistance when she tried to fold the door back. There were dozens of light bulbs inside. But she persevered, just as she had persevered with Lisa."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:09:41.91","The crunch and clatter brought us also scampering down to the phone booths. ""Broken,"" said Lisa Cody. Everyone asked Lisa how she'd done it. But all she would say was, I've got a long, skinny arm."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:09:55.87","Lisa Cody disappeared two days later. Somewhere between our ward and the cafeteria she slipped away. Nobody ever found her, though the search went on for more than a week."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:10:05.98","""She couldn't take this place,"" said Lisa. And though we listened for a trace of jealousy in her voice, we didn't hear one."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:10:14.43","Some months later, Lisa ran off again while she was being taken to a gynecology consult at the Mass General. Two days she managed this time."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:10:24.33","When she got back she looked especially pleased with herself."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:10:28.37","""I saw Lisa Cody,"" she said."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:10:30.64","""Ooh,"" said Georgina."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:10:32.32","Polly shook her head."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:10:34.01","""She's a real junkie now,"" said Lisa, smiling."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:10:57.71","One girl among us had set herself on fire. She used gasoline. She was too young to drive at the time. I wondered how she had gotten hold of it. Had she walked to her neighborhood garage and told them her father's car had run out of gas? I couldn't look at her without thinking about it."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:11:16.05","I think the gasoline had settled in her collarbones, forming pools there beside her shoulders. Because her neck and cheeks were scarred the most. The scars were thick ridges, alternating bright pink and white in stripes up from her neck. They were so tough and wide that she couldn't turn her head, but had to swivel her entire upper torso if she wanted to see a person standing next to her."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:11:46.44","Scar tissue has no character. It's not like skin. It doesn't show age or illness, or pallor or tan. It has no pores, no hair, no wrinkles. It's like a slip cover. It shields and disguises what's beneath. That's why we grow it. We have something to hide."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:12:06.32","Her name was Polly. This name must have seemed ridiculous to her in the days or months when she was planning to set herself on fire, but it suited her well in her slip-covered survivor life. She was never unhappy. She was kind and comforting to those who were unhappy. She never complained. She always had time to listen to other people's complaints. She was faultless in her impermeable, tight, pink and white casing."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:12:32.16","Whatever had driven her, whispered ""die"" in her once perfect-- now scarred-- ear, she had emulated it."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:12:40.65","Why did she do it? Nobody knew. Nobody dared to ask. Because what courage. Who had the courage to burn herself? 20 aspirin, a little slit alongside the veins of the arm, maybe even a bad half hour standing on a roof. We've all had those. And somewhat more dangerous things, like putting a gun in your mouth. But you put it there, you taste it, it's cold and greasy. Your finger is on the trigger and you find that a whole world lies between this moment and the moment you've been planning when you'll pull the trigger."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:13:15.02","That world defeats you. You put the gun back in the drawer. You'll have to find another way."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:13:22.85","What was that moment like for her, the moment she lit the match? Had she already tried roofs and guns and aspirin? Or was it just an inspiration?"
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:13:32.55","I had an inspiration once. I woke up one morning and I knew that today I had to swallow 50 aspirin. It was my task, my job for the day."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:13:41.90","I lined them up on my desk and took them one by one, counting. But it's not the same as what she did. I could have stopped at 10 or 30. And I could have done what I did do, which was go onto the street and faint. 50 aspirin is a lot of aspirin. But going onto the street and fainting is like putting the gun back in the drawer. She lit the match."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:14:04.03","Where? In the garage at home where she wouldn't set anything else on fire? Out in a field? In a high school gym? In an empty swimming pool? Somebody found her, but not for a while."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:14:19.79","Who would kiss a person like that, a person with no skin? She was 18 before this thought occurred to her. She'd spent a year with us."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:14:28.19","Other people stormed and screamed and cringed and cried. Polly watched and smiled. She sat by people who were frightened and her presence calmed them. Her smile wasn't mean, it was understanding. Life was hellish, she knew that. But her smile hinted she'd burned all that out of her. Her smile with a little bit superior. We wouldn't have the courage to burn it out of ourselves, but she understood that too. Everyone was different, people just did what they could."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:14:57.78","One morning somebody was crying. But mornings were often noisy. Fights about getting up on time and complaints about nightmares. Polly was so quiet, so unobtrusive a presence that we didn't notice she wasn't at breakfast."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:15:11.35","After breakfast we could still hear crying. Who's crying? Nobody knew."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:15:17.12","And at lunch, there was still crying."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:15:19.33","""It's Polly,"" said Lisa, who knew everything."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:15:22.48","Why? But even Lisa didn't know why."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:15:26.14","At dusk, the crying changed to screaming. Dusk is a dangerous time. At first she screamed, aah and ee! Then she started to scream words. My face, my face, my face!"
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:15:40.19","We could hear other voices shushing her, murmuring comfort. But she continued to scream her two words long into the night."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:15:47.99","Lisa said, ""Well, I've been expecting this for a while."""
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","2","Act One. Girl, Interrupted","host","Susanna Kaysen","00:15:51.76","And then I think we all realized what fools we'd been. We might get out some time, but she was locked up forever in that body."

"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","host","Ira Glass","00:17:27.81","Act Two, Guided by Voices."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","host","Ira Glass","00:17:31.17","Pat Deegan heard voices and she was a psychologist. When she was a girl the voices were friendly. She thought everybody heard voices. She didn't know that other people didn't."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","host","Ira Glass","00:17:40.53","But when she turned 17, the voices changed. They became vicious, critical, unbearable. She was diagnosed as a schizophrenic."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","host","Ira Glass","00:17:49.21","Years later, as a psychologist herself, she thought the only way mental health workers can really understand what their patients go through is if they hear the voices too. So she and some other people who hear voices got together to make a tape. They talked about the kinds of things the voices normally say to them and put together a script and had it recorded. And then they set up these training sessions where mental health workers would listen to this tape on a Walkman."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Dr. Patricia Deegan","00:18:14.28","And while they are listening to the voices, we also have them go through a mock psychiatric emergency services situation where they receive a mental status exam. They go to a mock psychological testing center where they do a reading comprehension test. They go to a mock day treatment program where they do some cognitive puzzles. And we also send them out into the community to have some kind of interaction. Get four quarters for a dollar, for instance, where they have to have some kind of social exchange with the public while experiencing these voices."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:18:45.70","And the actual voices that we're hearing on the tape, are these people who actually experience voices or they--"

"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:18:51.00","--actors? They are?"
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Dr. Patricia Deegan","00:18:52.25","These aren't actors, no. All of us were voice-hearers."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:18:56.33","And are people simply reciting the voices that they themselves hear in their head sometimes?"
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Dr. Patricia Deegan","00:19:01.38","No, interestingly, we decided as a group that that's, for voice-hearers, much too dangerous a thing to do. People can actually internally get into enormous conflict and go into enormous crisis by revealing the content of what it is their voices are saying. Voices, very frequently, don't want to be broadcast all over the place. And so we had to take great care around that as voice-hearers ourselves."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:19:29.11","And so, for example, I think there's a man on there who says, you disgust me. That isn't his own-- that isn't what he, himself, hears, that's what somebody else might hear?"
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Dr. Patricia Deegan","00:19:38.56","That's right."

But it's not at all unusual for people to have more than one voice and to have more than one voice activated or talking at the same time."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:20:34.60","Are the voices generally negative? Are they saying negative things?"
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Dr. Patricia Deegan","00:20:38.38","That seems to be a characteristic of people who are showing up for help with the voice-hearing experience, is that there aren't a predominance of helpful or good voices as we would call them."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Man 2","00:20:51.72","Filth, swine, disgusting garbage eater. I said you. Yeah, that's right. You stink. You stink. Filth, dirt, smirk, laughing, huh? You're not funny. You're pathetic. [LAUGHTER] You stink. Stinky, stinky, stink, stink. Stink. The only thing that's funny around here is you. That's right."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:21:27.45","It's interesting because over the last few days, as a been thinking about this and listening to the tape and looking at your book, I've tried to be aware of whether in some low level way, I hear voices in my head. And I feel like I hear songs run through my head a lot more than I hear actual voices. And I was wondering if you view what voice-hearers experience as being just on a continuum from what everybody experiences in their everyday life?"
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Dr. Patricia Deegan","00:21:55.25","I think that the idea of a continuum is a nice one, but I'm afraid in this way I don't think it's accurate to talk about voice-hearing as being a continuum. The big, big, big difference between hearing the song in your head and having experience of hearing distressing voices is that first of all, in the truest sense of hearing, you don't hear it in the way that you hear my voice right now. The voice-hearing experience is first and foremost and most primordially, a profoundly auditory experience. To the point where you can actually startle if a voice starts up suddenly and you turn around and you're wondering where it all started, and if someone is actually in the room."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:22:45.51","I feel silly that I didn't understand that up until this point. Somehow I had thought that what we were talking about were just simply-- I didn't realize that it was an auditory experience that one might confuse with actually hearing a sound in the room."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Dr. Patricia Deegan","00:22:59.71","Oh, absolutely. You absolutely hear it."

"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Man 3","00:23:17.16","Oh. Ah. Ah, I can't stand it anymore. You are disgusting."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Man 3","00:23:29.71","Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Get in the house.

We know. They all know. Stop it. Stop it."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:23:52.21","Among the materials that you've put out, there's a pamphlet called, ""Coping with Voices: Self-help Strategies for People Who Hear Voices That Are Distressing."" You have advice for people who are hearing voices, the simple things that they can do. And one of them that you suggest is-- just to take a typical one here. One of them is using ear plugs. You say that some people have found that putting an ear plug in an ear can greatly reduce or eliminate distressing voices?"
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Dr. Patricia Deegan","00:24:14.85","Yes, this is an interesting finding. And empirically what they've found is that putting the wax in both ears does not work. You have to try through trial and error, work with you right ear, then your left ear."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Dr. Patricia Deegan","00:24:31.72","For some people, for instance, putting it in the right ear, leaving it there for 15 minutes, will interrupt the voices. And in some cases, make them go away."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Dr. Patricia Deegan","00:24:42.40","For other people you leave it in the right ear for 15 minutes and it's only when you take the plug out that the voices are interrupted and/or stop."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:24:50.06","Do you have any thoughts about why it might work?"
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Dr. Patricia Deegan","00:24:52.69","No, I really don't."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:24:55.37","Is it just as simple as, well, let's just change the situation and just any change, like any physical change might help?"
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Dr. Patricia Deegan","00:25:05.49","I think, frankly, after my studies and also through a lot of personal trial and error and learning experiences myself that there really is enormous truth that anything that promotes a sense of personal efficacy and power. That seems to be the key that these voices, which present themselves as the all-knowing, all-powerful, we know everything, we see everything you do, and on and on and on, to find that I can interrupt that powerful a force, really creates a space for me to have some power."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Dr. Patricia Deegan","00:25:40.51","And of course, this flies in the face of what much of modern psychiatry is saying. That people who are experiencing major mental illness are having broken brains and can't possibly take a stand towards what's ailing them, except to take medications. I feel we're doing an enormous disservice in the United States in particular, by saying that medications are the only answer."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:26:06.51","Pat, do you talk about your own experiences of voice hear? I don't want to intrude in something that's private that you don't talk about publicly and ask you questions on this thing if you don't."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Dr. Patricia Deegan","00:26:14.27","No, I do talk about it in some generality. Yes."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:26:18.70","In your own experience, have you successfully made voices go away completely? Do they come back sometimes for you?"
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Dr. Patricia Deegan","00:26:26.11","I live with distressing voices on almost a daily basis. Not 24 hours a day, but usually in the course of the day my voices do come. So, for instance, just before coming into this recording studio, I was sitting out in the waiting area. In the BUR offices. And there's a lot of what I would call white noise out there. White noise coming from a fan and a ventilation system in the room. And for me, that was very prominent. And for me and many other voice-heareres, a white noise situation is a set up for the emergence of distressing voices. So as that began to happen, I could say to myself, OK, it's going to be all right. I know I've got 10 minutes before the interview starts. And I pulled out an ear plug and I put it in my left ear, which is the ear that works for me. And I reassured myself that once I got out of the white noise situation that I would be doing better."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:27:26.89","How do you conceive of the voices that you hear? Do you conceive of them as being separate from yourself? Or do you conceive of them as being a part of yourself that you can recognize?"
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Dr. Patricia Deegan","00:27:37.32","I think that for me it's a goal to eventually be able to say these voices are a part of me. And that's actually one of the self-help coping strategies that I do use sometimes."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Dr. Patricia Deegan","00:27:51.56","So, for instance, if I have a particularly derogatory, awful voice that I might say as a coping strategy, today I am feeling like I am no good. Today I am feeling like I'm a worthless person. These are my thoughts. These are my feelings."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:28:08.93","Is that because when the voice is saying that, literally you are not having the feeling, oh, I'm feeling bad today?"
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","3","Act Two. Guided By Voices","subject","Dr. Patricia Deegan","00:28:14.51","That's right."

""It's a stretch, but I'm betting you're here about the tiny voices,"" she said, offering a glass of sherry to my visiting seventh grade teacher. ""I'm thinking of either taken him to an exorcist or buying him a doll, so he can bring some money as a ventriloquist."""

"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","5","Act Four. You Don't Have To Be Crazy To Work Here, But It Helps","host","Joel Lovell","00:47:04.10","We often made fun of the night staff. Said that they were as crazy as the patients. There was Joe, the monosyllabic bodybuilder, and John, the pathological liar, and Shawn, who arrived each night for his shift raw-throated and near tears from his own afternoon session of scream therapy. Between midnight and seven we'd say, it wasn't at all clear who should be carrying the keys."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","5","Act Four. You Don't Have To Be Crazy To Work Here, But It Helps","host","Joel Lovell","00:47:24.61","The suggestion, of course, was that during the day it was clear. And that those of us who carried the keys, the shrinks from Harvard, the nurses in charge of the floor, even the lowly mental health workers like myself, were all models of sanity in the midst of so much chaos."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","5","Act Four. You Don't Have To Be Crazy To Work Here, But It Helps","host","Joel Lovell","00:47:39.31","We had keys to everything. There was a key to the front door and a key to the nurse's station. There were keys to the therapy offices and to the linen closet and to the staff bathroom across from the quite rooms, two windowless, white isolation areas to which we also had keys. And of course, there was the restraint key, a thin pointed silver thing, more like a tiny pocketknife than a key that slipped into the buckle of the straps we used to secure a patient's limbs to the corners of a metal bed."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","5","Act Four. You Don't Have To Be Crazy To Work Here, But It Helps","host","Joel Lovell","00:48:04.85","If a patient wanted to use the toaster, we had the key. If they wanted to use their own nail clippers, they were kept in a cabinet and we had the key."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","5","Act Four. You Don't Have To Be Crazy To Work Here, But It Helps","host","Joel Lovell","00:48:21.92","During the day, we moved through the hall like a team of custodians, rousting patients out of bed, urging them to shower and dress and brush their teeth. To attend, in hospital parlance, to their activities of daily living. We ushered them into large group meetings and small group meetings. Meetings in which we discussed the dynamics on the hall, meetings in which we explained the effects of medication, meetings in which patients were often told news they didn't want to hear. That they would have to endure another round of electro shock therapy. That they were not well enough to attend their daughter's birthday party. That for yet another week, they would not be allowed to do almost anything unsupervised."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","5","Act Four. You Don't Have To Be Crazy To Work Here, But It Helps","host","Joel Lovell","00:48:56.90","It was a place where much more often than not, short-term hopes were dashed, ineffably sad outcomes were commonplace. And anger over illnesses that no one knew precisely how to treat could erupt spontaneously."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","5","Act Four. You Don't Have To Be Crazy To Work Here, But It Helps","host","Joel Lovell","00:49:08.52","We were constantly gauging the mood of the hall in the way that I imagine desperate farmers gauge the mood of the skies and reacting accordingly. There has to be more of a staff presence on the hall someone would say. Meaning that there was a palpable tension on the unit, a sense of danger in the air. And that rather than spending time back in the nurse's station blowing off steam and catching up on notes, we had to make our presence known out on the floor."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","5","Act Four. You Don't Have To Be Crazy To Work Here, But It Helps","host","Joel Lovell","00:49:37.67","Occasionally, for extra money, I'd work nights. Everything about the place seemed different at night. It's a sentimental notion, I know. But I could never quite shake the sense when driving through the front gate for a night shift of entering a parallel universe, a place where all the day's demons were laid to rest. Where medicines worked. Where minds were calmed. Where the safe haven we tried so hard to create during the day was actually made real."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","5","Act Four. You Don't Have To Be Crazy To Work Here, But It Helps","host","Joel Lovell","00:50:02.51","I'd drive slowly along the winding road to our unit and look out at the moon on the snow, at the lights on here and there in the red brick buildings across the hospital grounds. And I'd think that, for all the terrors a place like this connotes, it couldn't possibly look more welcoming, less coldly clinical than it did in the middle of the night. Night, of course, can have this effect anywhere. Exhaustion finally wins out over struggle. But the sense of calm that settled in at the hospital always surprised me."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","5","Act Four. You Don't Have To Be Crazy To Work Here, But It Helps","host","Joel Lovell","00:50:37.01","The job at night, such as it was, consisted mostly of just staying awake. If you were the staff member on checks, you were responsible for knowing where each patient was. You sat in the foyer with a flashlight and every 30 minutes made a tour from one end of the unit to the other, poking your head into each darkened room and shining a quick bloom of light on the patients asleep in their beds. It was a simple, remarkable thing to see, people in so much pain sleeping peacefully."

You Don't Have To Be Crazy To Work Here, But It Helps","host","Joel Lovell","00:51:09.66","And there was Tim, the former track star, who had gained so much weight from taking anti-psychotic meds that he'd spend hours each day with this high school yearbook in his lap, open to a page that had a photo of some graceful, muscled kid who looked vaguely like him."

You Don't Have To Be Crazy To Work Here, But It Helps","host","Joel Lovell","00:51:22.61","There was Ann, and Mike, and there was Carol, who's sister came every Thursday afternoon. Whenever she visited, I'd watch them in the foyer. Carol's sister talking and Carol staring out from behind her thick glasses, smoking cigarette after cigarette. Her face, her hair, like a smudged version of the attractive woman sitting next to her."

You Don't Have To Be Crazy To Work Here, But It Helps","host","Joel Lovell","00:51:42.21","My own brother, the person I loved most in the world, was a patient in a psych hospital in Saratoga, New York. It seems obvious now, though I couldn't quite articulate it to myself at the time, that I worked where I did not because, as I told myself, it would help me on my applications to medical school. But because it allowed me to be both closer to my brother and more distanced from him. To understand in some vaguely intimate way what he was suffering and to reassure myself that I was, in fact, safe from his madness. That I was so sane I carried the keys."
"52","Edge of Sanity","1997-01-31","5","Act Four. You Don't Have To Be Crazy To Work Here, But It Helps","host","Joel Lovell","00:52:14.30","Whenever I visited him, I couldn't stop myself from imagining us like Carol and her sister, his Goofus to my Gallant.

You Don't Have To Be Crazy To Work Here, But It Helps","host","Joel Lovell","00:52:30.07","After I checked on the last patient, I'd go back to the foyer and bide my time. I'd sit and drink coffee and watch the clock, waiting for the next half hour to tick by. Or I'd find a deck of cards on one of the shelves and play solitaire. Or sometimes I'd try writing letters to my brother that I never sent. Opening them with some bad joke about how at that moment, both of us were in a hospital, but he was probably deep into sleep and I was the one up scribbling nonsense."

I was probably out for 45 minutes, long enough theoretically for something terrible to happen. I woke to Carol standing in front of me in her night gown, a cigarette in hand. ""I need a light,"" she said. And then she sat down next to me near the foyer and made fun of me for falling asleep."
