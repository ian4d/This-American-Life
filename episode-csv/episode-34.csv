"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:00.89","Sure, the Democrats are doing great in the polls this week, but to consider where they are as a party, consider please the case of Joe Cabazuela, a middle class guy, used to vote Democratic, lives in San Diego, in a state that the Democrats have to take if they're going to take the White House. And let's begin with this fact about him. Although his parents emigrated from Mexico and eventually became citizens, he says that his entire family is in favor of proposition 187, the law that would deny public services to illegal aliens, no public schooling, no social services."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","1","Prologue","subject","Joe","00:00:40.40","To me, I don't think they should get a free education. If they want an education, they want to come over here, let them pay for it. Me, as a Mexican-American, I cannot go over there and get it. Their government is not supplying the needs of the people over there. That's why they're coming over here, because this government's giving it away free. Charge them for it. That's the way I see it."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:03.12","He says he voted Democratic most his life. And then, when George Bush ran for president, he just started seeing things differently. And although he, himself, had been on and off welfare a couple times, and although his daughter has been on welfare for five years herself, what the Republicans were saying, especially about welfare, made a lot of sense to him."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","1","Prologue","subject","Joe","00:01:25.02","Because I could be on disability if I wanted to. Because of my legs I am disabled. I've had three surgeries. But I refuse to sit at home and watch TV and collect a monthly check. That's not me. I believe that that's what made this country great, is the fact that we can work."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:45.82","The Republicans seem to share these middle class values. When I asked him if he liked any of the things that Democrats stood for, he paused a long, long time. And then finally he said--"
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","1","Prologue","subject","Joe","00:01:57.89","Well, what do they stand for? Women in the military. Gay rights."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:08.45","It wasn't that he disagreed with them. It's that they seem to stand for nothing, which brings us to the topic at hand-- this week's Democratic National Convention. Delegates had been instructed that when they talked to the press, they were to talk about the three big themes-- three big themes, I should say, designed precisely to win over voters like Joe Cabazuela."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","1","Prologue","subject","Ruth Horowitz","00:02:31.41","We have been told that we should be emphasizing the themes of opportunity, responsibility, and community."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","1","Prologue","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:02:37.27","But these themes are so vague. It's so vague. Anything could be community, opportunity, and responsibility. I mean, those could be the Republican themes."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","1","Prologue","subject","Ruth Horowitz","00:02:45.75","That's true. That's true."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:47.16","In fact, this woman, Ruth Horowitz, told me that her delegation, which was from Vermont, had been playing this little game with the theme. The way that it worked is that you'd try to make up a sentence using all the three words, and then you'd try to work that sentence into everyday conversation."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","1","Prologue","subject","Ruth Horowitz","00:03:02.70","So for example, if you're getting into the cab, you say something like, I feel it's my responsibility as a member of this community to give you the opportunity to get in first."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:03:16.90","In a certain way, this was not that different from what people were trying to do in seriousness. Several people went through the motions for me of trying to express their beliefs in terms of the three big themes. But it always had the air of somebody fulfilling a ninth-grade essay topic. It never had the directness and conviction that the Republican delegates in San Diego had when they talked to me about their very concrete goals-- 50% tax cut, banning abortion, getting school vouchers, stuff like that. And it's hard to imagine Joe Cabazuela would have been satisfied with what he heard among the Democrats."

"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","host","Ira Glass","00:05:29.31","Act One. Two days before the Republican Convention started, security was already very tight. Two days before the Democratic Convention, it was still possible just to breeze into the hall, walk into all the hidden corridors, go straight to the makeup room, to the speech writers' room, to the sign rooms, which are basically these big freezers filled with pre-printed signs for the pre-planned floor demonstrations. They said stuff like ""The Brady Bill,"" ""10 Million New Jobs,"" ""Protecting Education."""
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","host","Ira Glass","00:06:00.04","Late Saturday night, senator Barbara Boxer came into the mostly empty hall with a few aides, just to check it out. The wall of TV screens that's behind the podium had no images on them before she stepped on the dais. And then, as if activated by the mere presence of a United States senator, they filled with heartwarming black-and-white images of everyday Americans. Most of the other people in the hall to witness this were balloon wranglers."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","host","Ira Glass","00:06:30.24","One of the problems of trying to report on these conventions over a television and radio is that it's hard to convey the sheer size of what they're about, the hundreds of lavish parties each day, the millions of dollars of TV studios and offices bought and brought in just for this occasion, an Olympic village of these in trailers outside the hall, which all get torn down after four days. So to get a sense of the scale of this, let's just take one small aspect of it, and let's take the balloon drop. 150,000 balloons, in bags of 1,000 balloons each, they get hoisted slowly up to the ceiling of the United Center."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","host","Ira Glass","00:07:09.87","This is the second biggest balloon drop ever, according to Tanzi Lewis, who's one of the minority contractors who got the contract to do the drop."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:07:17.61","What's the next biggest job you've done to this job?"
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","subject","Tanzi Lewis","00:07:20.68","To be honest, my largest odd-job was at the Taste of Chicago this summer."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:07:27.51","How many balloons was that?"
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","subject","Tanzi Lewis","00:07:29.23","That consisted of only 1,000 balloons."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:07:32.57","So that's just the number of balloons in one of these bags."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","subject","Tanzi Lewis","00:07:35.49","That's correct."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","host","Ira Glass","00:07:36.57","It took 150 people four days and nights to fill the balloons. They did it at Malcolm X College, which is just two blocks from the convention site. One can only imagine what Malcolm X would have said about all this. Upstairs in the school, ""By Any Means Necessary"" is painted on the wall. Downstairs, 150 people were filling balloons to celebrate Bill Clinton, loading those into huge nets, each 40 feet long."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","host","Ira Glass","00:08:03.80","If you picture a bag that you could drive three pickup trucks into, you've pretty much got the idea of what one of these things look like. And 11 of them, filled with red, white, and blue balloons, lay on the floor of the gymnasium. The air was thick with the plastic, powdery smell of balloons. There's a sentence you don't get to say very often."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","subject","Tanzi Lewis","00:08:23.88","Take, twist, turn, in the net. Take, twist, not in the net."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:08:31.92","What is that, athletic tape around your fingers?"
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","subject","Tanzi Lewis","00:08:34.09","Right, to keep it from burning, because after a while your fingers start to burn. You get, like, a blister."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","host","Ira Glass","00:08:41.58","Surprisingly, even here, in Democratic Chicago, in a roomful of people preparing a big party for Bill Clinton, people who don't even know if they're going to get paid for their work, feelings about the president were tepid."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:08:53.81","Now, are you a big President Clinton supporter?"
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","subject","Woman","00:08:56.12","No. I mean, I support him because he's the president, but I'm voting for Dole."

"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","subject","Woman","00:09:03.94","Because I am a born-again Christian, and I don't believe in abortion, and I don't believe in certain things that President Clinton is for. America is turning away from God. And so, therefore, the God is turning from America. And I really do. And that's why you're having high crime rates."

"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","host","Ira Glass","00:09:35.92","It does kind of look like a job for the smurfs. The balloons are carried down the hall, up a stairway, around a series of tight turns and doorways, out onto a loading dock, and over two blocks on Damen to the convention building, where they're checked by the Secret Service, and then lifted up to the ceiling."

"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","host","Ira Glass","00:09:57.85","Of course, there has to be a balloon drop. It's the kiss at the end of the wedding. It's the money shot."

A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","subject","Heather Booth","00:10:19.64","We've got several speakers today describing what the winning strategy is for the Democrats, and to arm us so we go out for doing battle.

"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","host","Ira Glass","00:10:34.65","Every day, the DNC held these morning seminars. They combine practical information about campaign law, the latest talking points on issues, speakers, like campaign strategist James Carville, who used a mix of truths, half-truths, and, I have to say, real whoppers to inspire the party faithful."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","subject","James Carville","00:10:53.87","And I love when the Republicans and Bob Dole say, ""Well, the teachers are all for the Democrats."" OK, yeah, the teachers are for the Democrats. The tobacco companies are for the Republicans. Now, I got a question for ya. When your kids grows up, what would you rather do, be a teacher or smoke cigarettes?"
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","subject","James Carville","00:11:13.10","[LAUGHTER]"
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","host","Ira Glass","00:11:13.53","In fact, the tobacco companies sponsor both political parties, and that support included sponsorship of a number of events at this very convention. After Carville, Congressman Steny Hoyer presented a series of charts and graphs on overhead slides to make the case for how the Democrats could take 20 new seats in the House of Representatives, which would give them the House majority, and knock Newt Gingrich out of the speaker's chair."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","subject","Steny Hoyer","00:11:35.68","Now, this is the important point, because I want all of you to believe, deeply ingrained, intellectually and emotionally, when you go back to your states, Hoyer was right, we can win back the House of Representatives. Republicans currently hold 28 seats that traditionally perform Democratically. These are Democratic seats. We oughta have 'em. Republicans hold 77 seats that Clinton won."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","host","Ira Glass","00:12:04.03",""
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","subject","Charles Cook","00:12:32.98","I think Democrats have about a 30% or 40% chance of getting the House back, but that's down from about 50%, 40% or 50% maybe a month or so ago. One of the questions we're watching very carefully is something called the Generic Congressional Ballot test. It's when you ask, if the election were held today, would you vote for the Democratic candidate for Congress or Republican candidate? And we were seeing Democrats with a six-, seven-, even eight-point lead on a lot of polls late June, early July. And at that level, it was roughly a tidal wave of the magnitude that you saw Republicans win in 1994. Today, it's down at the two- or three-point range, which is right about at the edge of what they need to to get that House back."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","host","Ira Glass","00:13:12.16","Interestingly, Mr. Cook was one of the experts Congressman Hoyer cited, but when Congressman Hoyer quoted him, it was to support the case that a Democratic sweep was imminent."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","host","Ira Glass","00:13:26.68","In the convention hall, the rule of thumb is that the fewer colorful buttons someone wears, the more important they are. You probably also didn't see this at home-- but does everybody know this-- periodically throughout the convention, everyone on the floor would stop the business of politics and just do the Macarena. It happened over and over. The Macarena is the official song of the Democratic National Convention."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","host","Ira Glass","00:13:51.78","A political convention like this essentially has to solve a theatrical problem, how to take an ordinary person and make him seem larger than life. And that problem is compounded in the age of television, because who could we possibly know more intimately then we know Bill Clinton. He's in our homes every day on television. We've heard about his sex life. We've heard about his finances. We've heard about his bad investments. We know his ideas. We know what he eats. We know what the man wears jogging."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","host","Ira Glass","00:14:19.51","I mean, do you know what your friends wear jogging? Justin Hayford attended the Convention for American Theater. And he said to make him seem larger than life in this setting, they used one of the oldest tricks in the book, and that is the long, slow arrival. You know, where the person's constantly being announced. We're constantly hearing word of the great man's imminent arrival. And of course, there was the train trip, the 1,800-mile mile train trip."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","subject","Justin Hayford","00:14:43.13","That's gorgeous, because the most postmodern element about this convention is the performance of absence, that they are working extremely hard to make his absence a sort of ache, a longing for this man. And so, from the very first day, there are train updates. I don't know if these ended up on television or not, but there are train updates where they cut away on the large video screen to a little schematic map of his 1,800-mile train route, going through the Heartland, of course. And they would say, and here's a live shot of his train pulling into Lindley, Ohio or somewhere."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","subject","Justin Hayford","00:15:17.24","And you see a train going by. And people cheer as though they haven't seen a train before. And so he's getting closer and closer, and the gospel choir comes out and they sing, ""If you want him, if you need him, if you adore him, shout yes."" And they never mention who him is, so one must assume it's the president. So we're following his progress. I thought he was going to sail across the lake, is what I had heard, which I thought was a sort of beautiful, Cleopatraesque move, like coming in on a great golden barge, but he didn't. He came in by helicopter, which is quite an entrance."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","subject","Justin Hayford","00:15:51.44","And then Daley said, ""Mr. President, we've waited four days to see you."" Which I thought was the ultimate capper to that entrance, which is, we're dying for your presence, we are dying to eat you with our eyes, as though we haven't for the last four years. Every intimate detail of his life, we've seen."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","host","Ira Glass","00:16:16.57","So in the hall, did this create an aching desire to see the president? Well, Justin Hayford says that on the first day, with the first train update--"
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","subject","Justin Hayford","00:16:24.42","People screamed like it was David Bowie or something. And yesterday, I was there in the afternoon, and they did the same thing. It was the newest train update, and nobody paid any attention to it."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","2","Act One. A Little Tour Inside the Message Machine","host","Ira Glass","00:16:40.07","Of course, he says, when Bill Clinton finally did appear in person, by that point, he had appeared so many times in the hall on video, that there was something kind of thrilling to see him in person. You know, you're so used to him on television,. And in the age of television, that is the rarest thing of all, to see the man live. And the theater of it is really hard to beat."

This, by the way, is Wesley Willis, a local Chicago artist. So what are you go to say? Well, you know, you can kind of run out of things of inspiration, so then you can just going into just straight factual mode. You are the President of the United States."

And, well, you probably have guessed that political conventions are a big reunion for party regulars of the two major political parties. And unless you think about it, you might not realize that, for many reporters, it's also a big reunion. I saw people at the convention who I have not seen in years. And that was true in San Diego as well."

The journalists remain in their tents outside the United Center. In the first two days, between 3:30 in the afternoon and 7:00 at night, maybe a few dozen people pass through the section of the hall reserved for the periodical press.

She steps up in her pink suit, and when she sees that the podium is too high, kicks off her pink heels. She stands there girlishly in her stockinged feet, asking too many questions of the men around here. And you can see that, like everyone else who plays her adamantine role, she is far more vulnerable than she lets on. Later I hear from one of her speech writers that she's as nervous as she looks.

And so, when Dick Gephardt speaks, I'm able to crawl right up behind him on the platform and see what life looks like from the speaker's point of view. Essentially, life looks predetermined. The speaker stares into four teleprompters, one at his left shoulder, another at his right shoulder, a third mounted straight ahead of him across the hall just beneath the cameras, so that he can appear to be looking at you when you're watching him on TV. The fourth is embedded into the podium, just above his navel."

Gephardt has only to swivel back and forth between the teleprompters and pretend not to be reading word for word, which he is. ""We meet here to offer a vision, not just a show for television,"" he is saying. No wonder no one listens.

"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","3","Act Two. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:27:57.72","But Jackson is the exception. The average convention speech arises not out of the need of the speaker to say something important, but out of the speaker's desire to have delivered a speech at the convention. Its purpose, from the speaker's point of view, is to establish his position in the official structure of the Democratic Party. The big exception are the speeches designed to make people cry-- Ron Brown's widow, Jim Brady's wife, and Christopher Reeve are, of course, well-known victims.

With Democrats-- and maybe because they're in power in the White House, I'm covering a presidential campaign, it just always feels like this-- their careers are at stake whenever I'm talking to them.

"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","5","Act Four. TV Show","host","Danny Drennan","00:52:41.73","So I'm watching the Democratic National Convention the other night on C-SPAN, and let me just say how thankful I am that C-SPAN exists. The best part of the convention is when everyone is going home and all the other networks have moved on to other things, but there's good old gavel-to-gavel C-SPAN still filming every last bit, including interviews with teenage convention volunteers who refused entrance to one of the Gore daughters because she didn't have her ID with her."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","5","Act Four. TV Show","host","Danny Drennan","00:53:05.91","And C-SPAN also does this great phone interview thing where people from Canada can call up and tell America how much they hate our political conventions. How about you mind your own business up there in Canada? And stop reminding us that liberal is not an epithet in Canada, and about gun control in Canada, and about health care in Canada, and about all the other things the Democrats should be doing here that already exist in Canada. I'm totally convinced that people from the Canadian tourist board or whatever are constantly calling up C-SPAN pretending to be interested in American politics to try and convince Americans to move up north."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","5","Act Four. TV Show","host","Danny Drennan","00:53:40.44","And the other thing I like about C-SPAN is that it gets all the unscripted bits, like Hillary Clinton waiting for her cue to start talking, but then jumping the gun and then stopping, and then going ""great"" under her breath, totally angry, and then starting again and delivering her lines all deadpan, like so ticked off that she just made a fool of herself on live television."

"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","5","Act Four. TV Show","host","Danny Drennan","00:54:57.14","And how many so-called Hollywood stars could they bring in to speak during the convention? Like Edward James Olmos, who came up with the most brilliantly obtuse quote of the evening when he said, and I quote, ""the complexity of this question is so intense that I could never try to attempt to answer it."" That is a direct quote. What does that mean? And do I really need Edward James Olmos passionately giving me a definition of what dissing means?"
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","5","Act Four. TV Show","host","Danny Drennan","00:55:23.39","And someone should also probably talk to Christopher Reeve's manager. I mean, I hate to say it, but how much in common with the so-called people does a rich, overpaid, covered-by-health-insurance actor who broke his neck while enjoying some totally elitist equestrian sport have? And maybe the producers of this convention, who also produce the Oscars, where Reeve also appeared, gave Christopher Reeve, a three-engagement deal or something. Or maybe Christopher Reeve just sells his Nielsen share to the highest bidder."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","5","Act Four. TV Show","host","Danny Drennan","00:55:50.07","And let me just say, if I had to labor with every single solitary breath just to speak three words at a time, and then wait because everyone in the audience takes that as a cue to clap even though I haven't finish my point yet, I sure as hell wouldn't waste that breath on Bill Clinton. So then we get about five million people plugging Hillary Clinton's book. And then later, the convention moves on to the politically expedient death and personal medical catastrophe part of the show, exemplified by Al Gore's kid and sister and every other speaker this evening. Like there's nothing about Clinton that tugs our heart strings, so they have to bring in all these death and tragedy stories that have absolutely nothing to do with him."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","5","Act Four. TV Show","host","Danny Drennan","00:56:27.32","And so then we see Sarah Brady and her husband, Jim, and I'm sure that Sarah Brady meant well, moving her husband, Jim, around the convention stage like a living political prop, and talking about the Brady Bill and gun control. But if you look at Bill Clinton's track record so far, you might worry that gun control is just another step in Bill Clinton's goal to declare a national state of emergency and establish martial law in this country. He already wants to set up curfews, and he's already responsible for the biggest increase in FBI wiretapping in American history, and he wants to take away guns, and he wants to put more cops on the street, and the political protesters at the convention were supposed to be content with receiving a lottery-derived slot of time for them to protest."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","5","Act Four. TV Show","host","Danny Drennan","00:57:06.08","Could someone please clue me in to the moment in time when the Constitution of the United States started parceling out the First Amendment on a time-sharing basis? Are we going to have alternate side of the street freedom of speech at some point soon? And this is from the Democrats. And if you think I'm crazy, just count the number of times that Bill Clinton mentions the 21st century and new technology. How annoying is it when Bill Clinton goes on and on about wanting to hook up every school to the so-called information superhighway, when in reality the internet is a huge dumping ground of useless information? I mean, kids can't even read or write, but let's hook them up to the biggest waste of technology going. Of course, only after we sensor it."
"34","Democratic Convention","1996-08-30","5","Act Four. TV Show","host","Danny Drennan","00:57:44.66","And if I were paranoid, I would say that Bill Clinton is, in fact, Big Brother, who wants to preside over a hugely illiterate population, tied into the government via government-censored internet links, gunless and with cops at every street corner, entertained and sedated by Hollywood has-beens, in order to pave the way for his beast of the apocalypse, one-world government takeover. And maybe moving to Canada isn't such a bad idea after all."
