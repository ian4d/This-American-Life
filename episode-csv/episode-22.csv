"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:01.11","When I picked up the phone, it was my mom. And it had been about a month since we talked, which is not unusual and certainly my fault. Anyway, my mom said that she had been invited to speak with a group of women at the local Hadassah. My mom's a therapist in the Jewish suburbs outside Baltimore."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:24.18","And these Hadassah women had this group that met regularly. All of them were women in their late 40s through early 60s. And when the group first started meeting, they apparently discussed all sorts of things. It was wide ranging. But as time progressed, they realized that there was only one topic that they wanted to talk about and felt like they needed to talk about all the time, that they felt traumatized enough to have to talk about. And that was their relationships with their adult children."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:04.80","And at some point, this became the only thing that the group talked about, its official reason for being. And they had invited my mother to lead a discussion about how to get along with your adult children. So my mom is a big preparer. When she gets invited to talk on various psychological topics, she looks up articles, calls experts, talks to people. And as part of her preparation, my mom decided to call her own three adult children to see what advice they would give to the group about communicating with your children, about having a good relationship with your adult children."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:46.91","So my Mom had already talked to my older sister Randy out in California by the time she called me here in Chicago. And she explained to Randy, ""It's a thing about communicating with your adult children and how to be close to your adult children."" And she asked my sister what advice she would give to the group."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:06.95","Randy's advice was direct and to the point. She said, ""Tell them to get a different leader."""

"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:41.85","Today, Act One, Me and My Mom."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:45.84","Act Two, Sandra Tsing Loh and her father."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:02:49.86","Act Three, Sandra Tsing Loh, Her Father, and His Mail-Order Chinese Wives. Stay with us."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","host","Ira Glass","00:03:09.48","So in this conversation with my mom, I was in the unusual position of being able to look like the good child in the family for a change. My older sister, for a change, looked like the bad kid. And I was able to say to my mom, you know, ""Even if Randy thought that you weren't handling your relationships with us in the very best way, surely there was a way to express that that was a little less cruel."""
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","host","Ira Glass","00:03:34.00","And my mom asked me, OK, so what advice would I have for this group? And I suggested that in the families of a lot of my friends and I think in my family, I thought that one cause of a lot of tension is the fact that as a family, we don't have a story that we agree on about the past. The kids, my sisters and I, we have one version of what happened when we were children. And that version tends to be kind of dark, actually. Not completely, but there's a lot of darkness in it. And our parents have a completely different story."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","host","Ira Glass","00:04:12.11","And you know, I don't even think we need to come to a consensus. I don't think families need to agree about this stuff. I'm not even sure if they can agree. But I think there has to be some kind of mutual understanding that each side sees the past the way that they see it. So today's program will not be an attempt to find this common story, but it will be an attempt to define that gap as it exists in a few families. The holiday season is just ending and for so many people, the drama of the holidays is the drama of parents and grown children struggling to get along without disappointing each other or getting on each other's nerves."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","host","Ira Glass","00:04:54.30","So to begin our program right now, I'm pleased to welcome to our show, telephonically from Baltimore, my mom."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","subject","Shirley Glass","00:05:02.32","Can I say something?"
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:05:03.83","I was just going to say, feel free to amend or correct."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","subject","Shirley Glass","00:05:06.70","Yes. When I told your sister what you said, she said, ""Oh, I was just kidding. I didn't mean to be mean."""
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:05:13.82","Oh. Pfft."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","subject","Shirley Glass","00:05:14.26","So I don't want her to be [UNINTELLIGIBLE]."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:05:18.53","But you're a professional psychologist. Now, don't you think often-- don't you think that there was a note of hostility in what she said?"
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","subject","Shirley Glass","00:05:24.95","Oh, absolutely."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:05:25.79","OK. There, you see? Are you and I can agree. And frankly, she's not on the phone. So mom, the thing I wanted to ask you about is, OK, so you had this seminar with all these--"
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","subject","Shirley Glass","00:05:35.89","It wasn't a seminar. It was a discussion group."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:05:38.61","Discussion. The discussion group, excuse me."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","subject","Shirley Glass","00:05:39.44","And I was the facilitator."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:05:41.68","And how many women was it?"
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","subject","Shirley Glass","00:05:44.53","Around 30-some."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:05:45.88","Oh, so a lot. Now, if you had to characterize in a phrase people's relationships with their children, would you describe them as being very good, somewhat OK, generally kind of yucky? I mean, how would you describe it?"
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","subject","Shirley Glass","00:05:58.45","I would say that there were a lot of people whose dreams haven't been realized, whose expectations haven't been met. And so there's a sense of disappointment, although there were some people there who were pleased with all aspects. And then, of course, the question was, ""Well, why are you here?"""
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:06:16.43","To gloat? Was that the answer? To gloat and show you pictures of grandchildren?"
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","subject","Shirley Glass","00:06:21.13","A little bit."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:06:21.93","A little bit. Yeah, OK."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","subject","Shirley Glass","00:06:23.76","More to connect with the other women, I suppose. But these are the criteria for satisfaction. Do you want to hear them?"
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:06:32.01","Quickly."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","subject","Shirley Glass","00:06:33.01","Whether their children were married, so that having single children was a disappointment."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:06:39.45","I'm just going to make a little checklist here. Taking [INAUDIBLE] my own--"
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","subject","Shirley Glass","00:06:41.10","Whether their children lived close by of far away."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:06:45.48","God, I'm shooting 0 for 2 so far. Keep going."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","subject","Shirley Glass","00:06:48.12","Whether their children appreciated them."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:06:51.60","OK. I got 1 for 3."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","subject","Shirley Glass","00:06:53.68","Whether they had grandchildren. Somebody announced that one of their children was pregnant with the first grandchild, and everybody went ""Ooh,"" and they clapped. So that's the epitome. Whether their children were successful in their lives. How much they liked their child's spouse and got along with them."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:07:14.39","You told me on the phone earlier something interesting about this."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","subject","Shirley Glass","00:07:17.44","Yes. I told you that there were several people there who did not like their child's choice of a partner at the time that they got married but had grown to love them very much and in some cases even liked them better than their own child."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:07:35.79","See, now I wonder if that is because there is an inherent tension between children and their adult parents, that the child sometimes wants to be treated as the child and sometimes wants to be treated as an independent adult. And for the parent, it's pretty much a hellish guessing game. And then-- yeah?"
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","subject","Shirley Glass","00:07:51.98","Yeah. A lot of people talked about walking on egg shells. And several people said, well, what's the right way to give advice? And of course the answer is, you don't give advice unless somebody asks you for it."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:08:06.40","Do you think that this relationship is harder, the relationship between adult children and their parents, is harder on the parents than on the children?"
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","subject","Shirley Glass","00:08:16.12","Yes. Because the parents have a dream of how they thought it was going to be, and it seldom matches the dream. One person said that her children are all single, all live far away, and she said she and her husband are very lonely. And what's happened, the good part, is that they've gotten much closer to each other because they realized that they were all that they have."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:08:41.68","Right. Well, Dr. Glass, I'm afraid that this would be about all the time we have for this particular segment of our radio show."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","2","Act One. Me and My Mom","subject","Shirley Glass","00:08:49.35","Look, I'm glad for any time I can get with my children."

Immigrant parents in general tend towards eccentricity, don't they? They arrive from the old country, now they have VCRs and Cuisinarts, their children are growing up to be monsters, and worse, the local Ralph's stops carrying pig knuckles. For the record, my father does not wear his underwear backwards, only his sweaters. When the elbows wear through, you just turn them around and keep going. And yes, for the record, he did perform the Chinese snake dance for us kids, naked, armed only with a fluttering beach towel as he leaped and twirled, imparting his ancient Chinese folk song with a mournful howl.

Does my father, a retired aerospace engineer with science degrees from Stanford, Purdue, and Caltech, have to wear old underpants with holes in them?

That would be a little too how-sharp-the-sepant's-tooth.

"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","3","Act Two. Sandra's Dad","interviewer","Sandra Tsing Loh","00:20:54.57","OK. So there's the story. Here's the way I remember my dad first telling me and ending this. I remember you said that while Anjelica Huston was a good ride, she wasn't a dream ride. Because she had this friend to drop off in Beverly Hills, which took you a little out of your way. And at that point, it would've been quicker for you to take the crosstown bus because you had to transfer. But by then, I remember you lowered your voice, you're an expert in such delicate matters of decorum, and you said that you thought at that point, getting out might be a little rude. Papa, why don't you just take us out with a song?"

"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","4","Act Three. My Father's Chinese Wives","host","Sandra Tsing Loh","00:29:07.32","Let's unpeel this news one layer at a time. Question, is my father even what one would consider marriageable at this point? At age 70, my father, a retired Chinese aerospace engineer, is starting to look more and more like somebody's gardener. His feet shuffle along the patio in their broken sandals. He stoops to pull out one or two stray weeds, coughing phlegmatically. Later, he sits in a rattan chair and eats leathery green vegetables in brown sauce, his old eyes slitted wearily."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","4","Act Three. My Father's Chinese Wives","host","Sandra Tsing Loh","00:29:40.95","At times, he almost seems to be overacting this lizardy old part. He milks it. ""I am old now,"" he'll say with a certain studied poignance. ""I am just your crazy old Chinese father."" If he's that old, why does he still do the same vigorous daily exercise regime he's done for the past 10 years? 45 minutes of pull-ups, something that looks like The Twist and much unfocused bellowing. This always performed on the most public beach as possible in his favorite Speedo, one he found in a dumpster."
"22","Adult Children","1996-05-03","4","Act Three. My Father's Chinese Wives","host","Sandra Tsing Loh","00:30:15.81","No, crazy old Chinese father is, in truth, a code word, a rationalization for the fact that my father has always had a hard time spending money. Why buy a leather briefcase to take to work when an empty Frosted Flakes cereal box will do just as well? Papers slip down neatly inside, pens can be clipped conveniently on either end. Why buy Bounty paper towels when at work he can just walk down the hall to the washroom, open the dispenser, and list out a stack. They're free. He can bring home as many as we want. If you've worn the same sweater for so many years that the elbows wear out, turn it around. Get another decade out of it. Wear it backwards. Which is why, to this day, my father wears only crew-neck, not V-neck sweaters."

She allows herself a laugh, laying aside her customary dull hostility for a moment of more jocular hostility. ""So who does he think would want to marry him?"""

It's a disaster-- you and I symbolize that-- because he's passive-aggressive and he's cheap. But no. To him, it's that rebellious, Aryan strain that's the problem. You take an Asian immigrant just off the boat, for example. Here's a woman fleeing a life of oppression under a Communist government and no public sanitation and working in a bicycle factory for $0.10 an hour and repeated floggings every hour on the hour, every day of every week of every month of every year.

""From the four corners of the Earth, my lover comes to me playing the lute. Like the wind over the water."" He recites the words without embarrassment, almost without emotion. And why shouldn't he? The song has nothing to do with him personally. It is from some old Chinese fable. It has to do with missing someone, something, someplace, that perhaps one can't even define anymore."

Zhu Ping, for her bitter winters? My father, for the Shanghai he left 40 years ago? And what about Kaitlin and I? We are even sitting in our own childhood home, and we long for it."

Since today, Sandra didn't invite my wife, I have to let her stay in the kitchen at home. This song describes a young woman longing for her lover. It sounds like this. [SINGING IN CHINESE]"
