"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:00:40.80","See, this is the kind of event the Bob Dole campaign should have staged when he turned 73 this past week. They should have surrounded him with lively, young people, a big, happy event celebrating his vigor. A few of you may not know that particular piece of tape. It's a pretty famous piece of tape. It's Marilyn Monroe singing to John Kennedy in 1963, which in my view, makes it even more appropriate for Bob Dole to use."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:09.99","Marilyn Monroe and John Kennedy are his contemporaries, after all. Bob Dole is 73. If Marilyn Monroe were alive, she would be 70. John Kennedy would be 79."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:23.50","But instead of a big, lively event, a hall full of boisterous young people, where did the Dole for President campaign stage its big birthday photo op? In an old age home. There in the paper, you could see the pictures, Bob Dole with some senior citizens."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","1","Prologue","host","Ira Glass","00:01:47.22","You really had to wonder, what were they thinking? What message are they trying to get across to us? Does this campaign have the will to live?"

"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Ira Glass","00:04:21.52","And his writing is really some of the most remarkable writing anybody is doing about the campaigns, because basically, he's this really funny, smart guy who writes like a novelist, more than like a political reporter, though there's a lot of political analysis in it. The political analysis gets encased in these scenes, in these little stories. And it's just a complete pleasure to read. And then he's just got a really great eye, a really great eye for the telling moment. And he's been following around all the different candidates."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Ira Glass","00:04:50.90","We're going to play you now a set of stuff that he's written about Dole, just because, among other things, he captures all these moments nobody else gets. And they reveal all these things about Dole and his campaign. I'm going to start with this. Let me get some music going here again."

"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Unspecified","00:05:08.66","There we go. This first little diary entry is from back during the primaries. This is February 15. This is after the final New Hampshire debate. And this is this debate where there was this one moment where Dole kind of got into a little shouting match with Steve Forbes. Remember him?"
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Unspecified","00:05:29.19","And Dole basically said to Forbes-- Forbes was running all these negative ads. And Dole's staff or Dole came up with this stunt where Dole would say ""Those ads are really inaccurate. And plus, if you're going to be talking about me, you could at least use a decent picture."" And then Dole hands him these pictures, which Forbes snaps back at him, this and that."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Unspecified","00:05:51.61","OK. So all that gets covered in the press. But after the debate, people leave. The stage is empty. And our little Michael Lewis heads out onto the stage. And he's looking at all the detritus left over, the notes the candidates write themselves, all this stuff that nobody else really bothers with writing about."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Unspecified","00:06:14.10","And then he sees the photographs. I'm going to read from this campaign diary, and then we'll go to Michael reading. He says, ""I noticed the photographs. They lay on the shelf beneath Forbes's podium. They were not prints but originals, curled and soiled, as if they'd been sitting in some shoebox for years, until Dole stumbled across them late one night while he was worrying about how to retaliate against Steve Forbes in the big debate."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Unspecified","00:06:35.46","Two are color, a bad one of Liddy, Dole's wife, who's stunning in the flesh, looking here tired and plain. A better one of dole's dog, Leader, rubbing noses with a yellow lab. The third is a black and white, of Dole smiling broadly, holding a baby. He looks 20 years younger. The black pen he clutches to keep his right arm in place juts up and is set off by the baby's white gown. Dole is looking at the camera. The baby is looking at Dole's gnarled, wounded hand."" Here's Michael Lewis."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:07:06.88","I asked five different Dole aides the identity of the baby held by Dole in the photograph he gave to Forbes. It seems an innocent enough query. After all, this was the picture Dole had selected for publication. I get no answer."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:07:22.63","The basic pose of the Dole campaign is the less anyone finds out about their candidate, the better. You can spot the Dole office in the row of glass boxes on the ground floor of the New Hampshire Holiday Inn. It's the one with the newspaper taped up on the glass to prevent people from outside looking in. Dole himself remains largely out of sight. He makes two or three very brief appearances each day and is otherwise unavailable for interviews."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:07:49.41","Dole's speeches add nothing to the general blank picture. A dozen times I listened to his talk, pen poised idly over paper. Nothing, not a thought, not an image, not a quote."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:08:02.66","It took me a while to figure out why this was, but then it struck me. Bob Dole wasn't running for president. The concept of Bob Dole was running. The man himself had subcontracted out all the dirty work to people who make their careers out of this sort of thing. That was why he was referring to himself in the third person. He wasn't there, at least not in any meaningful way."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:08:34.20","It turns out that everything I will discover about Bob Dole, I will discover by stealth. My first discovery? He's embarrassed by his own vanity. I catch him in a back room at one event, just before he's about to go onstage. He thinks no one is looking. He checks out his reflection furtively. His hair is sprayed and dyed. And then he whips out of his pocket a tiny canister and squirts two quick blasts of breath spray into his mouth."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:09:01.87","Also, his wit is genuine. It's not just an act. I stalk him through the snow at the world dog sledding championships and watch him meet and greet the pooches. A schoolgirl approaches as he's about to leave and after nabbing a photo, asks him if he's having fun. ""You learn a lot out here campaigning,"" Dole says, motioning to a sled of 20 dogs. ""They're all nice dogs, too, not like the Congress."" He thinks no one is listening. He's said it just for the fun of it."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:09:35.96","All other data about Bob Dole must be inferred from the world he has created around himself. The Dole campaign consists of slick young men in blue suits, forever whispering to each other in dark corners. The campaign pays top dollar for everything. And I get the feeling that most who work for it have some personal financial stake in Dole soldiering on, and that they'll be the last to tell him that he really shouldn't be doing this again."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:10:02.92","You also get the feeling that there is very little the campaign would not do. One of their favorite techniques has been to hire telemarketing firms to call Buchanan supporters and, in the guise of pollsters, relate damning untruths. In response to Buchanan's complaints, the Dole people tell reporters that Buchanan is doing the calling to a few of his supporters to tar Dole. It takes a special sort of credulity to believe them. I stopped half a dozen people carrying Buchanan signs who told the same stories of strange phone calls in the night."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:10:39.69","One afternoon, I abandoned the Dole campaign for the steam room at the Manchester YMCA to purge myself of the dreadful feeling coming over me. A few minutes later, an extremely fat old man waddles in, spies me, drops his towel, and sits on a plastic stool right next to me. ""You're a new face,"" he says. ""I always notice a new face."" I say, ""That's nice,"" grab for a towel, and tell him I came for the campaign."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:11:08.73","He shifts on his stool and says, ""I'm a Buchanan man, myself."" Buchanan men are the kind of guys who can sidle up to other guys in steam rooms without the slightest fear of being thought gay. Moments later, he's complaining about the calls he's getting at home. Here, roughly, is what he said."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:11:27.24","""A guy calls. He says, 'Hi. My name is William, and I'm calling from the Dole campaign. Are you aware that Pat Buchanan is an extremist?' And I say, 'What do you mean?' And he says, 'Pat wants to give nuclear weapons to South Korea and Japan.'"
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:11:42.22","So I ask him, 'Where does this information come from.' He says he doesn't know. So I ask him, 'What does Bob Dole think about that?' And this kid doesn't know that, either. He knows absolutely nothing about Bob Dole."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:11:55.63","So I ask, 'Who are you, anyway?' And he says he's with an organization called the National Research Institute in Houston. So I ask him for his phone number. And he says he can't give it to me. Then he hangs up. There is, of course, no listing in Houston for the National Research Institute."""
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:12:22.48","In short, the Dole campaign is a lot like what a lot of people probably suspect the Buchanan campaign is, closed, secretive, smug, a bit nasty. Maybe that's what happens when you lose once too often. You stop trusting the voters."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:12:39.59","And yet I still want badly to like Dole. I'll bet he's the guy in the race that people most badly want to like, but can't quite figure out how to do it. Every night after a day with Dole, I return home and recall to my mind a pair of mental images that the day has badly blemished. The first is the one of Dole recuperating from his war wounds, as described by Richard Ben Cramer, hanging by his bad right arm and trying to straighten it out until he was sweating and crying from pain. The second is a windy afternoon last June in a graveyard on the French coast, when, Dole now says, he realized he had to run for president one last time."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:13:23.10","I traveled there on Clinton's plane to witness the D-Day celebrations. But about halfway through, I lost interest in writing about it and just started watching. You gaze down the cliff onto the beach and just marvel. How did these men do this?"
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:13:39.25","Just before Clinton addressed the veterans of the Normandy invasion, I found myself walking alone through the rows of white crosses, until I reached a place where there was no one else but a pair of veterans. They seemed ancient, though of course, they could not have been much older than Bob Dole. They were trembling and leaning on each other as they looked down on a cross. And at first, I thought it was just from the strains of age."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:14:04.07","Then I saw the name and place on the cross, Stenson, I'll say, from Mississippi. The boy had died at the age of 19 on the first day of the invasion. The old men wore name tags, too. Stenson, from Mississippi."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:14:25.74","Two of three brothers had survived that day. They were crying without tears. That's a bit like Dole, I would like to believe. He's crying without tears. He has the emotions, or at least, you can sense them lurking inside them. But he has no idea how to give them proper expression."

And then that's the big joke, that this gruff, 70-something person is living with the 20-somethings. And Andrew Sullivan makes the case, no, no, there's actually something to be learned from this. There's actually a deeper truth that we can find in this. He writes the following."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Unspecified","00:17:32.14","""Bob Dole, very unlike his rival for the presidency, is actually, I think, a natural Gen X-er, someone whose ironic detachment, bleak humor, and occasional bursts of dark sentiment make him far more intelligible to the under-35 crowd than most politicians. At 72, he is in some ways the ultimate 20-something candidate. To wit, his remarkable, revealing, and insistent use of that quintessential Generation X mantra, 'whatever.'"""
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Unspecified","00:18:11.00","And then he's got a whole bunch of examples of Bob Dole using the word whatever, whoever, wherever, the various permutations. Here are some. Let's see."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Unspecified","00:18:24.26","""Well, I think Lowell Weicker probably did more in the Congress of the United States for disabled people in this country, children, adults, whatever."" Or, ""That's one way to address it for some people. But you're right, all economic classes, whether you're white, black, whatever."""
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Unspecified","00:18:43.39","The hint here, Andrew Sullivan writes, is that Bob Dole knows he's reciting a list of groups that he should feel deeply sincere about. But he can't at that moment feel completely sincere about them. So he gently undercuts the blather he's required to express by adding the W word."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Unspecified","00:18:59.98","We know he's in favor of helping the poor, underprivileged, disabled, veterans, whomever. But we also know he's not exactly smitten with empathy for their plight as he utters the words. He cares, but with an understandable and often funny level of detachment."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Unspecified","00:19:24.02","Compare with Clinton. A ""whatever"" barely passes the president's lips. There is nary a scintilla of detachment from his sympathy for everyone and anyone at all times, and indeed a fear, even panic, that anyone might suspect otherwise. Dole is different."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Unspecified","00:19:52.00","Sullivan goes on in a little section of this to argue that this ironic distance is actually something admirable, in a certain way. He quotes a couple more examples of him saying ""whatever"" in different situations. He says, ""There are signs that Dole is aware of the complete silliness of much of what passes for political ritual. He knows that the throngs cheering for him today will be cheering for someone else tomorrow, that enthusiasm is fickle, that real support for someone like him always has something completely contingent about it. So he condescends to it under his breath in a throwaway, that wistful grin snickering up his face toward his black, darting eyes."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Unspecified","00:20:38.04","Like the members of Generation X, Dole is post-just-about-everything. The difference, of course, is that he lived through it, and they were born after it. Dole, it's clear, has few illusions about the world. He's seen white-shirted revolutionaries have their moment and leave nothing but a deficit behind. His irony is not, as some boomers would have it, an expression of ennui or listlessness or cynicism. It's the sanest response to the real world, if you'll pardon the expression."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Unspecified","00:21:17.55","Members of Generation X, despite the fashionable assumption, are not disillusioned. They're merely un-illusioned. Their wariness is endemic. Dole gets this. Clinton never will."""

The announcer brings on stage, one at a time, all the politicians who have endorsed Dole. They race out onto the stage like ballplayers before a game. Dole waits in the background until the crowd reaches a low fever pitch. A quick squirt of the breath spray, and he's on."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:22:11.33","He stands at the podium with his left foot and left side jutted forward, though he's right-handed. His crippled right hand rests on the podium, but it's not a prop. He'll start in with something self-deprecating. ""That's a lot better than the speech is going to be."" Something like that."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:22:29.59","Presently, the voice of Dole emanates from the Milford, New Hampshire, town hall's facade. It's not so much a speech as a series of disconnected phrases uttered in an elegiac tone, some of which cause the people around me to break out into giggles. ""Like everyone else in this room, I was born,"" Dole says. A Dole speech sounds like the sort of thing a red brick building would say if a red brick building could speak."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:22:56.57","He pulls the rhythms of his ""one America"" refrain up short, just as it starts to flow.

I'm not sure whether Dole is actually modest or simply embarrassed by immodesty. I leave thinking that a man like this runs for the presidency not because he thinks he should be president. He thinks no one else should be president, so it might as well be him."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:24:10.18","May 27. You never saw a more unhappy-looking group than the journalists assigned to follow Dole into New Jersey on Memorial Day. ""I got the best seat in the house to the worst show in town,"" rumbles a cameraman as we board the plane at National Airport. ""I just came in case he got shot or something,"" says a reporter, who doesn't even bother to take notes."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:24:30.70","I, too, have my misgivings. Usually, my campaign notebooks are crammed with anecdotes, observations, and incidents. Whenever I'm with Dole, however, they simply refuse to fill up. The Dole campaign remains an arid, sterile place. Not much grows there."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:24:48.45","Today is a kind of prelude to the general campaign, which will be relaunched in earnest tomorrow with a bold journey across the country. Dole marches for a dozen blocks through Clifton, New Jersey, in front of the parade's single float, bookended by his wife, Elizabeth, and Governor Christie Todd Whitman. The crowd is quiet and sparse, less than one deep."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:25:11.44","The parade climaxes in a park, where Dole is meant to make a few remarks and lay a wreath on a symbolic grave site. I wait there for him, watching members of the local veterans organization subtly jockey for position. Six old men form the color guard, dressed in red jackets, VFW caps covered with patches and buttons, and the apprehensive air of people who fear they might be asked to improvise."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:25:35.46","But the really striking thing about them is how old they look, at least compared to Dole. They could almost be a different generation. ""Any veterans of the first World War here?"" I ask. ""We just buried our last one last fall,"" says one, who sports a POW-MIA pin in his cap. ""Don't come around here 10 years from now,"" says the man beside him, ""or we won't be here, either."""

It turns out that we are flying all the way across the country to spend less than 24 hours in California before picking up and flying back. First to Chicago, where we'll spend tomorrow night, and then to Ohio, on May the 28th, five months before the election. The only reason it doesn't seem insane is that several hundred seemingly sober men in dark suits follow Dole wherever he goes. There is a kind of ambitious young person who mistakes frenetic movement for advancement in the world. They'll call you from the road and say, ""I'm in Bangladesh on business, heading for Iceland."" And you know that he thinks this is sufficient explanation of his purpose in life."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","2","Act One. Campaign Diaries","host","Michael Lewis","00:26:50.88","The Dole campaign has something of this feeling.

But as various political dignitaries loudly disapprove of drive-by shootings, a small group of dissenters forms on the fringe. All but one are the Hispanics who bear the brunt of the new anti-crime esprit. They're hauled off to jail for all sorts of odd crimes, carrying baseball bats into the park after 7 o'clock in the evening, for instance."

And the second lady is like, ""I don't like the situation we're in one bit. I don't see anyone with any high morals or good ideas, and I don't like Bob Dole. I don't like his stance on issues. Plus, I think he's too old."""
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","4","Act Three. TV Politics","host","Danny Brennan","00:51:58.60","And the first lady's like ""Too old."" And the second lady is like, ""Too old. He would be a one-term president."" And the other lady is like, ""Definitely a one-term president."" So maybe Bob Dole should ride around on New York mass transit to get a sense of what he should be doing. And then Bob Dole goes on about what he's done for women, saying, ""I've been living with a woman,"" which was a really, really weird thing to say."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","4","Act Three. TV Politics","host","Danny Brennan","00:52:29.06","So then we get an advertisement about health insurance sponsored by the Republican National Committee, showing this smirking kid breathing through a tube while his mother goes on about what we need. And then there's a commercial for life insurance featuring these crying statues in the rain. And I don't know that it's such a good idea to remind people about sickness and death when Bob Dole is on the program."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","4","Act Three. TV Politics","host","Danny Brennan","00:52:48.48","And Larry King brings up Susan Molinari again, like, ""Yeah, Larry, we get your little prearranged scoop. Quit working it so much."" And Larry King is like, ""How did you get involved in this tobacco thing?"" And Bob Dole is like, ""Just blew in, I guess."" And then you realize that Bob Dole keeps looking at himself in the monitor, or else someone is there backstage that he's looking at for cues."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","4","Act Three. TV Politics","host","Danny Brennan","00:53:07.31","And how sick is it to refer to the undeniable pull of tobacco company money in Bob Dole's pocket as something that ""just blew in""? And then Bob Dole says he's not a scientist and so couldn't know that smoking is addictive, which is weird, because later he refers to relatives who were sick due to smoking-related problems. How much evidence do you personally need, Bob Dole?"
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","4","Act Three. TV Politics","host","Danny Brennan","00:53:27.69","And then Larry King is like, ""Would you tell Americans to stop smoking?"" And Bob Dole is like, ""Yeah, all of you stop smoking."" And Elizabeth Dole qualifies that with ""pregnant women and elderly people with respiratory disorders."" Where do you think most respiratory disorders come from, Elizabeth Dole?"
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","4","Act Three. TV Politics","host","Danny Brennan","00:53:42.07","And then Bob Dole is like, ""It's not good for you. It's bad for your health. Don't do it."" And having said that, like he was about to go on, but Elizabeth Dole interrupts him and goes, ""That's it."" And they all laugh. And we get an arthritis pain medication commercial and a denture cream commercial."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","4","Act Three. TV Politics","host","Danny Brennan","00:54:01.76","So then Larry King is asking Elizabeth Dole about what she's going to be doing as First Lady. And she starts going on about being a supportive spouse. And Bob Dole makes a joke about calling her up for a transfusion. And then he looks at the monitor again. And meanwhile, Elizabeth Dole is going on about going around the country to places where mentally challenged youths are making beautiful products. And I swear to god, if she got any more condescending, I was going to seriously put my foot through the television."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","4","Act Three. TV Politics","host","Danny Brennan","00:54:27.35","So then Bob Dole goes on the record as not speaking about Clinton's character by listing Whitewater and Filegate as two things he hasn't talked about, even though he just did. And then Larry King brings up more records. And then Bob Dole goes, ""Trust."""
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","4","Act Three. TV Politics","host","Danny Brennan","00:54:40.06","And then Elizabeth Dole starts going on about how Bob Dole was a poor farmboy whose family moved their kids into the basement to rent out the house to make ends meet. How depressing is that? No wonder Bob Dole has a sour demeanor all the time, since he grew up with no windows."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","4","Act Three. TV Politics","host","Danny Brennan","00:54:55.63","And then Elizabeth Dole goes on some more, like maybe she should let her husband talk just a little bit. And then Larry King brings up the Jimmy Carter question. ""Can you say you would never tell a lie?"" And Bob Dole goes, ""Yes."" And Elizabeth Dole goes, ""Yes."" Whose question is that?"
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","4","Act Three. TV Politics","host","Danny Brennan","00:55:12.17","And then they go on and on about affirmative action. And then Larry King promises to take phone calls for, like, the 50th time. Maybe no one is calling in or something. And then we get that health insurance commercial again and an ad for some ginseng-based energizing dietary supplement to help you feel not so old."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","4","Act Three. TV Politics","host","Danny Brennan","00:55:35.53","Next, they're talking about the stock market. And we finally go to calls, but Larry doesn't seem to know how to work the phones. And the caller's from Georgia. And I was hoping it was that guy who called up when Jesse Helms was on, thanking him for all his work in controlling blacks, only he didn't say blacks. But it was only some guy asking about running mates again. The one call that they take on the show, and it is some yokel who didn't get that they weren't going to talk about possible running mates."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","4","Act Three. TV Politics","host","Danny Brennan","00:55:58.38","So finally, we get Susan Molinari on the phone from a restaurant somewhere, gushing on and on about Bob Dole to the point where they probably should have cut her off. And Larry King asks whether Susan Molinari thinks her pro-choice abortion stand is going to be a problem. And Susan Molinari is going on about how, ""This is the man to bring the convention together, and there is no greater honor in the world than to speak on behalf of the gentleman currently on your show."" You would think Susan Molinari just found God or something, the way she was going on about it."
"29","Bob Dole","1996-07-19","4","Act Three. TV Politics","host","Danny Brennan","00:56:25.11","And all I want to know is does Susan Molinari on the phone to Larry King count as a paid Republican advertisement for Bob Dole, especially when Larry King points out that Bob Dole is the guest who's appeared most on the Larry King show? And then Larry King makes a point of reminding all the news flunkies out there that the two points from his show to remember are ""Never lie"" and ""Susan Molinari."" And I don't think November could be any scarier in my mind at this point."
