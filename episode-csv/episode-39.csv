There's a lot of rewinding and replaying this video, which John taped off the Sci-Fi Channel. John, and Thax, and Ericka have watched actors forget lines, they've seen scripts left on beds, they've seen props fall over and smash. Periodically, there's an offstage cough. And what Thax describes as the sound of a giant zipper, mysterious, inexplicable, and not part of any story. When the vampire, Barnabas Collins, enters the foyer of Collinswood Manner, he closes the door behind him, and a moment later it swings open again."

"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","2","Act One. Dark Shadows","subject","Thax","00:04:02.25"," So John thinks they had a lengthy meeting deciding that you have to have four knocks instead of three, to spice up the plot a little bit. It's more exciting."

He claims that there is a point, in the 1969 episodes when, suddenly, all the characters started saying, groovy and freaky. By his calculations, the episodes that we're watching this night, were probably filmed in February 1969. One clue--"
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","2","Act One. Dark Shadows","subject","John","00:04:43.82"," Because in the summer, when it's summer, you can hear the air conditioner running."

"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","2","Act One. Dark Shadows","subject","John","00:04:51.82"," I mean, it's like the studio is next to an alley that had big garbage dumpsters, because there's always flies on the set. It's like the thing that's so amazing. There are scenes where flies are sitting all over people's faces, and they're pretending that they're not there."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","2","Act One. Dark Shadows","host","Ira Glass","00:05:11.37"," It's kind of a character study, which actors decide to shoo the flies away, and which ones ignore them and continue bravely through the scenes."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","2","Act One. Dark Shadows","subject","Thax","00:05:18.78"," But the classic fly scene is like, when somebody was doing an exorcism, and the fly just went right into his mouth. So he just went [BLOWING SOUND] like that to get rid of it."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","2","Act One. Dark Shadows","host","Ira Glass","00:05:30.42"," What's interesting about all this is that not only does it defy the way you're supposed to watch horror films, it defies the way you're supposed to watch drama. They do not suspend disbelief for one second. Instead, they construct elaborate fantasies, not about the characters, but about the actors who play the characters."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","2","Act One. Dark Shadows","subject","John","00:05:46.57"," There's like a real vulnerability to all the characters. And even people that you don't like on the show, like the Chris Jennings character, he's this horrible actor, and that Beth character, she's like a horrible actress, but after a while you get really attached to them. Because you feel like you could just see her going off stage and going, oh my god. And people going, oh, you did really well today. There's a life behind it."

Dark Shadows","host","Ira Glass","00:08:13.52"," Somewhere during the second episode of the night, I realized that, not only are these stories convoluted and hard to follow, they're incredibly boring, boring in a way that invites speculation and embroidery by the audience. For instance, the reliable father figure in this program is Barnabas Collins. And he's supposed to be this really great guy, and everybody loves him, and he's always jumping in and saving people. So why is he a vampire? Thax says it can be sort of disconcerting at times."

You know can't do a Halloween show without at least one truly spooky story. And this one we have fits the bill pretty well. But, of course, in keeping with our pledge that everything that is supposed to be scary about Halloween will be rendered harmless during our program today, what we are bringing you is a spooky story that happens to somebody who is completely unafraid, totally unafraid, could care less. A woman named Carol Estler moved into an old house in Massachusetts in the 1970s. And in this story you're going to hear her and her daughter describe what happened."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","3","Act Two. Scientists in a Haunted House","host","Ira Glass","00:12:57.77","At first they noticed these patches of wavy air, like when you see heat rise off a barbecue grill. And they heard sounds, people walking, stuff clattering around, when there was nobody around. Once Carol was walking to the barn, and suddenly she says, there was a just a wall in front of her, just this force, this force blocking her way. And she said she waited, and eventually it went away. And she didn't tell anybody about it."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","3","Act Two. Scientists in a Haunted House","host","Ira Glass","00:13:22.65","And a few days later, her daughter ran into the kitchen and said she was walking to the barn, and an invisible wall blocked her way. Carol Estler was a professional scientist, and she tried to find other explanations for what was happening other than ghosts. But the data all started to point in one direction."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","3","Act Two. Scientists in a Haunted House","subject","Carol Estler","00:13:40.08"," One night, I was lying in my bed, and I was just about ready to fall asleep. And the strangest thing was that I suddenly felt my body start to move. It was like, if you could imagine your body was magnetic, and someone was taking a magnet and sort of moving it slowly around your body, and was pulling in kind of a broad gentle way, one way and then the other."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","3","Act Two. Scientists in a Haunted House","subject","Carol Estler","00:14:07.49","It really felt like my body was being pulled from the outside. And I'm a scientist, so I watched. And I watched, and I got wide awake. And I watched that for almost two hours as my body was sort of pulled one way, then pulled the other way, really a very strange feeling. And I was getting really, really tired. Somehow that pulling was just making me so tired. So I thought I'd try an experiment. And I said, out loud, look I'm really, really tired. Will you please stop? And it stopped."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","3","Act Two. Scientists in a Haunted House","subject","Carol Estler","00:14:49.29","Now I don't know that I ever really talked to anything. I don't really know what was there. It was just a very strange experience. But still, we kept trying to find other explanations. And for me, I stopped trying to find other explanations when, one night, I woke up, I don't know why, and I just looked across the room, and there was a woman standing there. And she was just standing. She was looking around at things. She wasn't looking at me. She wasn't looking at anything that seemed to be in the room. She seemed to be looking far off. And then she turned, and she walked out of the room, right through the closed door."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","3","Act Two. Scientists in a Haunted House","subject","Carol Estler","00:15:37.49","I thought about that for a while, quite a while. And I think I've pretty much accepted now that I live in a house where there are ghosts, leftover pieces of other people who don't really see me, because the woman didn't seem to see me or anything in the room. Sometimes, I can see them. Sometimes they can move things and move me in ways that I can feel or see. Sometimes they can make noises. They certainly don't seem to be trying to bother us. I suppose, maybe, even they experience us as ghosts, because we probably look invisible to them, the way she couldn't see me. It's a very interesting house to live in."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","3","Act Two. Scientists in a Haunted House","subject","Carol's Daughter","00:16:29.89"," The important one I haven't mentioned yet is the crying baby. I have not experienced the crying baby, although she is said to spend a lot of time in my room. The first time someone experienced it, they were sleeping in the small room off of mine. It was a guest. And there were no children in the house that night. And the next morning he said, where was the child crying all night long? I heard a child crying all night long."

Scientists in a Haunted House","subject","Carol's Daughter","00:17:12.15","There's an old foundation on the back part of the property, which is supposed to have dated back from a house in Revolutionary times or earlier, which had burnt here and, supposedly, burnt in it was a woman and a child."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","3","Act Two. Scientists in a Haunted House","subject","Carol Estler","00:17:31.80"," Certainly, I had no training in anything like that. I come from three generations of scientists, and ghosts just don't fit. But if you're a real scientist, into research, then one of the most basic parts of you is the principle that everything you know is wrong. Every theory, every model, somehow breaks down. And it doesn't matter whether it's quantum mechanics, or nuclear physics, or super conductivity, in some way or other, the model is incomplete. In some way or the other, the model is wrong."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","3","Act Two. Scientists in a Haunted House","subject","Carol Estler","00:18:11.84","And the way you learn, in science, is to keep pushing your models until you find out where they're wrong. And I think, living here in this house, I've got some new models in my science."

"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","4","Act Three. Vampire Girl","subject","Shawna Kennedy","00:21:13.50"," Because people in power don't need to say a lot. So if you say as little as possible, it gives people the impression that you are more powerful than they might necessarily feel."

"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","6","Act Five. Gang Girl","subject","Gang Girl","00:47:13.85"," She said that she don't know, and she don't want to know."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","6","Act Five. Gang Girl","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:47:16.38"," And what did you think of it at eight?"
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","6","Act Five. Gang Girl","subject","Gang Girl","00:47:18.89"," At age eight, I just kind of wondered why it was there, and how they got it up there. That was my whole big thing. I think that, as a child, you wonder those things. And I just kept wondering, how did they get it up there? And I just thought it was newspaper. And it was a person."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","6","Act Five. Gang Girl","interviewer","Ira Glass","00:47:35.97"," And how long was it up there?"
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","6","Act Five. Gang Girl","subject","Gang Girl","00:47:37.34"," It was up there a couple days. It was up there a couple days. Because it was like stenching, it smelled, and they cut it down. The police came, and they cut it down. And the banana had already fell off. And that was it. And nobody said anything. Nothing went out. There was no screams. There was no nothing. There was just somebody come, cut it down, picked it up, put it in a truck. Police came, scanned the area, came back once. That's it. Nothing was ever mentioned, nothing."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","7","Act Six. Screams","host","Ira Glass","00:48:25.11"," Now we move to Act Six, Screams. Well, a few months ago we introduced you to Dr. Greg Whitehead, of the Institute for Scream Studies, who has been collecting screams from around the world. And his thesis is this. He says that we tend to think of the scream as a kind of monochromatic, sort of binary unit of information. Someone either screams or they don't. They express a kind of scream-ness, or they do not."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","7","Act Six. Screams","host","Ira Glass","00:48:49.72","Whitehead says that is very simplistic. That there are hundreds of different kinds of screams, and there's meaning to divine from screams. And we have to divine that meaning. And he invited your screams, yours, for his collection, for his analysis. And dozens of you called and left your screams on voicemail. And I felt, what would a Halloween program be without screams?"

"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","7","Act Six. Screams","subject","Male Caller","00:50:16.95"," Hi, I'm the lead singer in a band called Hatewave in Chicago. And I heard a little bit about your studies, and it reminded me of the music I play in this band. The lyrics are all screaming, and screaming is a really great thing. And it's a lot of fun to listen to. So I'll give you the first verse from a song called ""Vodun Goat"". [SCREAM]"

"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","7","Act Six. Screams","subject","Male Caller","00:51:24.41"," I think screaming is a release, but I don't have that much to release, because I think it's kind of funny, after listening to your message. So I'm just going to scream a little, OK? Here I go. [SCREAM]"
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","7","Act Six. Screams","subject","Female Caller","00:51:40.78"," Yes, hi. I think this a very interesting proposition, because I think screams reveal a lot of subtleties of character. And I've always liked sounds, sound for its own sake. So I think this is really interesting. And when I was growing up, I was not allowed to scream. I was a very, very quiet, good child, so for me to scream, at all, in public is really unusual. So here I go. [SCREAM]"
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","7","Act Six. Screams","subject","Child Caller","00:52:22.14"," Hi, I'm eight. One thing that makes me scream is-- when I go on a roller coaster, I scream because I'm having fun. [SCREAM]"

"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","7","Act Six. Screams","subject","Male Caller","00:53:00.55"," Hello, I was listening to the radio the other night, and I heard abou the scream line. And I just thought I'd kind of leave a little story on how I scream, and where I do my screaming. Right now, I'm calling you from a car phone. I work in Sacramento, California, and I live in the San Francisco Bay area."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","7","Act Six. Screams","subject","Male Caller","00:53:26.26","And I make a drive of 109 miles, not every day, but at least three times a week, back and forth. And so I'm dealing with customers at my job, and I also have to deal with the other participants in this commute. So what I do is, when I'm in the car, and I reach about, well, it's about this point in the drive-- I guess, I'm about 75 miles into the drive-- I always, get all my anger, and stress, anxieties, and everything else with a good old scream."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","7","Act Six. Screams","subject","Male Caller","00:54:13.15","I really didn't know anybody else did anything like this until I heard your radio show. So here's my scream, and this is what I do. [SCREAM] And I really do feel much better after I do that. It clears my lungs. I actually can see better. Even though I wear glasses, I actually can see better."

And it's hard to think of actually doing it. It would be nice to-- I thought when I was going to call this number that maybe it would be requested to scream or encouraged to scream."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","7","Act Six. Screams","subject","Female Caller","00:55:13.09","But it's so hard to do here in the city. And I'm out in a bungalow on the northwest side of Chicago. And the neighbors are probably about four to, I don't know, six feet away, or maybe 12 feet away with some walls in between. And I just feel like it wouldn't be appropriate to scream."
"39","Halloween","1996-10-25","7","Act Six. Screams","subject","Female Caller","00:55:36.67","So I wish I could be someone who could scream. When I was living in the mountains in California, I could sing my screams, and just do it. It was great. It was a wonderful way to express myself and to release a lot of things that I was holding in. But I can't do it in the city. So that's what I wanted to say. Maybe I'll call back another time and say stuff too. OK, thank you, bye bye."
