A group of friends gets together, decides to start a business, put on a show, or begin their own church, or take a political stand, together, as a group. Hearts are full. Everyone's close. But over time, there's some small thing that comes up, some dispute. And the dispute starts small and takes on more importance, and more until it becomes the most important thing that any of them think about. Until it becomes the main thing that they all think about. And until it destroys the group."

"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Ira Glass","00:01:43.06","Joseph Smith and Brigham Young received visions when they founded the church and established it there. And to this day, it is not uncommon for Mormons to see visions and to set up their own variations on the main LDS church."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Ira Glass","00:01:58.66","Scott Carrier has the story of one such splinter church, how friends began it and how the friends over time, split apart."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Scott Carrier","00:02:07.78","This is a story about a group of radical Mormon polygamists who live in central Utah in a little town called Manti. I call them radical because they've all been excommunicated by the church authorities, not for practicing polygamy, not because they were sinners. They were excommunicated because they said over and over again that the church authorities were working for Satan."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Scott Carrier","00:02:30.16","I'll begin this story by introducing Jim Harmston, a middle-aged man of common qualities, a man who used to sell real estate up in Davis County. He was a Mormon, a good Mormon, a member of the high council. He had a house on the hill and a new Continental every six months."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Scott Carrier","00:02:45.52","But then, in 1990, he started to believe that the church had become wicked in the eyes of the Lord, and he started praying in the true order, and seeing angels, and receiving divine messages from across the veil who told him first that he should quit his job and move with his family to Manti, which he did. Next, to become a polygamist, which he did. And then, to become the prophet and president of his own new church, the True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days, which he also did."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Scott Carrier","00:03:15.55","He did, in effect, have very nearly the same experience that Joseph Smith had 160 years before."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","subject","Jim Harmston","00:03:22.23","I had an experience where four dispensation heads came across the veil and laid their hands on my head-- Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and Moses-- restoring again the apostleship. And this happened on a Sunday. They were magnificent resurrected beings clothed in white garment, white clothing, to their robes hung to their ankles. They had white hair and beards. They were magnificent, and I was overwhelmed with the Holy Ghost. And it's been interesting to observe. People give up their careers and their professions, their businesses, and begin to gather here in Manti."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Scott Carrier","00:04:51.39","On Sunday afternoon, Harmston's church has a testimonial meeting. 150 men, women, and children on folding chairs in a newly constructed meeting hall. Testimony meeting is a Mormon tradition where members stand and bear their testimony in the truth and validity of the church and its doctrines. But many of the people here have recently been excommunicated, and so their testimony is that the Mormon church has become corrupt. Indeed, that this congregation now is the only true and living church on the planet."

And just tonight I got my witness. And it's burning within my soul at how important this work is and how true it is. I know it is. And it's hard to believe that just a year ago I was in high school. I was in plays. I was a typical teenager. And now I'm in a plural marriage and struggling. I'm not going to lie to you."

"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Scott Carrier","00:06:52.13","Members of Harmston's church practice the principle of plural marriage because they believe polygamy was one of the fundamental teachings of Joseph Smith. This is why polygamists often refer to themselves as fundamentalists."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Scott Carrier","00:07:04.49","They also believe in practicing the law of consecration, wherein all goods and services are held in common, a communism, and that there will be a gathering of God's chosen people into a nation, a Zion nation. This gathering is to be in a safe spot, an area protected during the Millennium and the Armageddon. It's all there in the Book of Revelations, and it's all happening now. Hundreds, some say thousands, of fundamentalists from around the West have moved to Manti over the past three years, all believing that this is the place for the gathering."

And I moved here to Manti 15 years ago because the Lord told us to move here. I've seen a lot of people come and go from this valley for spiritual reasons that are totally different. They didn't even know who Jim Harmston is. And they come, and they go."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Scott Carrier","00:08:05.96","Steve McKinley and Jim Harmston used to be friends, but now they're more like enemies. They met when Harmston moved to Manti in 1990, and so McKinley has seen the development of Harmston's church from its beginning. It began as nothing more than a group of men from the Manti area who came together once a week and sat in a circle in an upstairs bedroom."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","subject","Steve Mckinley","00:08:26.43","There were 17 men who came together because they were concerned about things that were being taught and accepted by people as doctrine. And we were concerned, and we came together. And we prayed, and we asked, Heavenly Father, will you teach us? Will you tell us what is your doctrine and what is not? And will you protect us as individuals against things that we might do that would destroy ourselves?"
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two.

"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","subject","Steve Mckinley","00:09:15.97","So there were two reasons that we came together-- to pray together and to help each other with our temporal needs."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Scott Carrier","00:09:23.65","They also did a lot of talking about the evils of the new world order, perhaps the need to stockpile weapons, the necessity of taking the kids out of the public schools, various conspiracies, secret combinations, and so on. The men held the meetings in each other's homes. And on special occasions, they'd set up a tepee on top of a mountain."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Scott Carrier","00:09:43.29","In the tepee, they'd sit in a circle and bear their testimony and pray in the true order, which is a secret Mormon ritual that's supposed to be performed only in a temple."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Scott Carrier","00:09:53.47","Mormons believe that by praying in the true order, the veil that separates heaven and earth can be parted, enabling angels and messengers of the Lord to cross over into this temporal plane. Which is exactly what the men say started to happen in the tepee."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Scott Carrier","00:10:08.20","They say their prayers called down lightning and thunderstorms from heaven. They say that this is where God first told the group to organize themselves along Iroquois guidelines, wherein all decisions were to be made by unanimous revelation. Not just unanimous consent, unanimous revelation, where everyone would pray and have a vision, the same vision, at the same time."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Scott Carrier","00:10:29.99","Then they all received a vision that they should give each other titles like war chief and peace chief and medicine chief and historian so that every man would be a chief with certain responsibilities, but that no man would be the ultimate chief with control over all the others."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","subject","Steve Mckinley","00:10:45.00","I recall the testimony meeting. And Jim Harmston stood up and he said, if any man here were to stand and declare himself a leader amongst these men, there would be 10 men who would stand up and shoot him in the knee caps, because none of us independently are the leader. We are a group of individuals who have come together, and nobody has authority over anybody else. That's how it started. That's how God called us together."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Scott Carrier","00:11:21.00","The men started calling themselves the high council and then realized by unanimous revelation that they were actually new apostles of the Lord and that they should begin an entirely new church, the True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days and that they should start confirming each other as members."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","subject","Steve Mckinley","00:11:39.69","And so I asked Jim if he would confirm me. And as I sat in the chair facing the wall-- not the window, but the wall in Bart's living room--"

"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","subject","Steve Mckinley","00:11:53.12","Facing east. I had my head bowed, and my eyes were closed. And when I opened my eyes and was wondering why he was pausing. And then I closed my eyes again and I saw three men walk through the wall."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","subject","Steve Mckinley","00:12:10.75","It was Joseph Smith and Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball who came through the veil. And they placed their hands upon my head and revealed many things concerning my life and my [UNINTELLIGIBLE] to certain things upon this earth that I should do. And I could see the vision as he spoke. I could see it, and Jim described what he saw, what we both saw in vision. And Jim was so overwhelmed, he closed the vision. Because he was so overwhelmed he could not continue the vision, Jim ended it. But it continued for me. And I saw many things that Jim did not speak."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Scott Carrier","00:13:01.28","The first major conflict within the new church came early on. One of the high council apostles, Randy Dalton, the historian, came to a meeting and presented a teaching on polygamy he called ""Hearts and Flowers."""
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","subject","Randy Dalton","00:13:14.28","I have a firm testimony that we are to become perfect. The Lord has commanded us, be, therefore, perfect, even as I or my father in heaven are perfect. Well, what does that mean? In the Greek and in the Hebrew, the word that is used that we translate as perfect really means to be whole or complete. I do not believe that it is possible for us to become whole or complete through intimate relationship with only one other person."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","subject","Randy Dalton","00:13:46.31","Now, the fact of the matter is that men just do not form emotionally intimate relationships with other men. It's really kind of foreign to our being. And yet, look at women. They have these incredibly emotionally intimate relationships. They know everything about each other. The empathy is incredibly. They feel what the other is feeling. And there is, in fact, one of the problems that is fundamental to most marriages, is that a woman craves a kind of nurturing in her relationship, in her marriage, that men are rarely capacitated to give. We're just not the nurturing types. And yet, a woman needs that. And as men, we just tend not to be able to give it."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","subject","Randy Dalton","00:14:38.46","And yet, a sister wife can give so much of that emotional support that as men, we're just not very good at doing. And it can work very beautifully if you can get over issues like jealousy and things like that that get in the way. So I was talking about these kinds of things."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","subject","Steve Mckinley","00:14:59.01","We thought he was talking about homosexuality, and we were going to go out there and rip his head off. We were upset because we didn't understand. We thought, is he talking about homosexuality? If he is, we're going to set this boy straight. We're going to explain some things to him. And Randy says, wait a minute, guys. That isn't what I said. You see, let me tell you."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","subject","Steve Mckinley","00:15:26.63","And so we talked about it for a long time. And that's not what Randy was talking about. But we misunderstood it, and so did a lot of others. A lot of others thought that's what he was talking about. That was not it."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Scott Carrier","00:15:39.81","It was a teaching that grew into an argument, that grew into a conflict that couldn't be resolved. The question wasn't whether polygamy was OK. Everyone agreed that it was. The question was about sex, whether a polygamist man could have more than one of his wives in bed at a time."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","host","Scott Carrier","00:15:56.03","For two weeks, the group met and prayed in the true order. Some said it was an abomination. Others weren't so sure."
"21","Factions","1996-04-26","2","Act Two. Political Faction","subject","Steve Mckinley","00:16:03.20","I told you earlier that many of us experimented with different things. The true order prayer, we experimented with a lot of things. I think that Joseph Smith was the greatest example of an experimenter. He experimented with a lot of things. He had seer stones and peep stones and witching rods to witch wells and water and all kinds of things. He experimented. He tested. There were many of us who tried and tested this so-called understanding of our sexuality with our wives. Many of us on both sides."

He said, ""Battle not with monsters, lest you become a monster. And when you gaze into the abyss, the abyss is within you."" And I think that's what happened is that Jim Harmston has spent so much time fighting against the LDS church that he's become a general authority. It may well be that every abuse he has accused the LDS church of may yet be found in his own circle."

But at Harmston's house, his two wives were upset and not talking to each other. The first wife told me she'd gone after Jim that morning with a frying pan. The second wife hid in the back room.
